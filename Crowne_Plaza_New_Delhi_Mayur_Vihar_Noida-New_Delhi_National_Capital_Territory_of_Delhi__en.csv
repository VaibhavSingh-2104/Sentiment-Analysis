"Buffet spread dinner experience at infinity crown plaza was average Even though there’s quite wide choice of food, starters could improve along with soft drink options Probably it’s due to lack of space but a strange arrangement of salad and pudding in between sitting place was weird arrangement Good atmosphere, friendly staff, food quality good","May 7, 2019"
"Exceptional personalized service is given by Manager Mr Ratan always.  I traveled all over world, this is one of the place where you feel home away from home.Wholesome Breakfast (rather call it brunch) one must not miss.","May 6, 2019"
"Frequently stay at the hotel due to work requirements Executive chef TARUN & Chef Khan , along with the duty incharge SUMIT at the Infinity restaurant always take care of our late hours food requirementsExceptional & personalised service ","May 5, 2019"
"Stayed here for 2 nights with my wife and kid. First thing that caught my attention in this hotel was the service, which was outstanding and everyone right from the security gate to front office and restaurant was so friendly and caring. Lovely breakfast buffet with wide variety of Indian, Continental and Oriental spread. Only let down was that their pool was under maintenance which was not updated in any of the booking sites or even in their website. I have seen many hotels doing it and when you pay a premium you expect it to be flawless. Apart from that, we really enjoyed our stay! Will definitely be back. Thanks to the entire team.","May 4, 2019"
"As a crystal club member, I stayed at Crowne plaza, Mayur Vihar, Delhi for one night with my family. We had booked two rooms. While one room was complimentary, the other was at a rate of 3999 plus taxes. Mr Gaurav from the management team was kind enough to arrange for the room reservations in advance.The check in was quick and smooth. The lobby are is spacious and they have a separate lounge bar on the ground floor. We were given two adjoining rooms on the 10th floor. While our preference was Akshardham facing rooms, we were given Noida city facing rooms and the view from these rooms was also not bad. The evening/ night view is particularly good with the lights on in the city buildings. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. Each room had a king size bed, a large LED TV, a study table, a couch and centre table. The windows were large with remote controlled curtains. The washrooms came with a full size tub, a separate shower area and were fully stocked with towels and toiletries. Each room also had a mini bar, a tea /coffee maker, an ironing table and a safe to keep your valuables.My daughters went for a quick dip in the pool in the evening. The health club and spa are also on the same floor. Their room service was quick. The spread for breakfast was quite good and we enjoyed our Sunday breakfast at leisure.The staff at the hotel and in the restaurant was very courteous. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel thoroughly and would love to come back again.","April 30, 2019"
It was first time stayed with Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar and it was a great experience to stay with Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar. Food was awesome and staff is trained and duly dedicated towards their job. Overall great experience.,"April 29, 2019"
Crown Plaza is a wonderful Host. It was a great experience for my family. We were all tension free throughout the event. Crown Plaza Mayur Vihar has delivered what they promised initially.Nishant has been great coordinator and was very helpful whenever we were hassled or had any query. We wish him all the best for his future.Overall a great experience. thank you Team Crown Plaza Mayur Vihar.,"April 29, 2019"
"This place is almost amazing. Step inside and you'll feel like you are in any cosmopolitan city, with it's beautiful decor, polished service, and well executed menu. Food was fabulous. Just awesome.. Can't explain how happy I am. Especially thanks to Mr.Dinesh.","April 28, 2019"
"Mr.Dinesh always gives good smile and memories about India. India itself is not easy to enjoy , but for the people, bohta achahae. Ps, find Mr.Dinesh for any help.Beatiful Paneer:)Other food like pizza is authentic. Noodles are good for Asian.","April 28, 2019"
"Everything about the stay was nice - from the checking process - Akash was really kind and helpful, to the bell boy - sardarji, i dont remember the name though - he was so professional and made me think if I am at a luxury 5 star spending 4 times the amount - the likes of a taj lake palace or an amar vilas etc. The overall experience at the property was good - the room/suite was rather spacious and they greeted and spoke well- also offered to give a show around (Akash). Although I used car but should someone want to use metro, its equidistant from two metro stations. The view was just OK but Akash took care of the minutest detail - from ensuring I get a good view to a room on a non smoking floor etc. The morning breakfast was rather nice - not very elaborate but the service was outstanding - as I said, it gave me a feel of a luxury 5 star in a business 5 star property. The morning stewards to servers were all very throughtful in guessing my needs and serving me much before what I would need, they were observant. The checkout was great too. Just one thing - I had a chat with Shagun - their marketing manager, I guess. All I wanted was a show around, which Akash had anyway offered. I wanted to cover the good aspects about the property in a video that I inteded to post on my youtube channel, but despite having a conversation, they never returned. I also did not give much heed deciphering their message that they are not interested in the proposition. Anyway, albeit this minor distaste, everything else was fabulous. I will return.Also, did i mention, their mattresses are outstanding. Not to mention, the housekeeping was impeccable. Near perfect stay.","April 26, 2019"

A fantastic hotel with fantastic friendly staff especially Dinesh who became more of a friend than a waiter to us. Not only did he recognise us following a fortnight of touring but when we returned he could even tell us our preferences in drinks. An all out nice man. In fact a gentleman in the truest sense of the word. Thank you Dinesh for making our stay so enjoyable.,"April 13, 2019"

"I have stayed here twice. Highly recommend it. It's about 45min to an hour from Delhi international airport. The hotel is clean, tidy and orderly. Staff are friendly and the service has always been great. The rooms are generous and comfortable - good beds, linen, plenty of room to lay out luggage - I think we had a king room. Good internet/power points/desk/chair for those who have to work. Bathrooms are spacious and well stocked.The restaurant has a good combination of Indian (veg and non-veg) and European style foods. Chef is only too happy to come and help you put together some great combinations and show you how to eat the amazing Pani Puri! There is also a separate bar to catch up with friends or just chill - good range of drinks.","April 4, 2019"

"This is the second time I have stayed at Mayur Vihar and both times I have very much enjoyed my time there.The rooms are clean, spacious and the beds the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The TV has a great range of Movies and TV shows in English.I ate mostly in the Lounge and all the staff there are fantastic and so welcoming, the menu has a good choice.I used the Spa frequently and found they have a wide range of treatments and professional staff.I'm looking forward to staying again in May.","March 29, 2019"
"This is a very pleasant and comfortable hotel. The rooms are elegantly furnished. The beds are extremely comfortable. One of the best features of this hotel was the excellent service provided by the staff.They were extremely accommodating and did their utmost to make sure the stay was pleasant one. We were always treated professionally with warmth, kindness. The dining room was excellent. There were many options on the menu, and everything we ate was freshly prepared and delicious.

Had a great workout session with the instructor mr.bhagwan das. Good wuality gym equipment and well maintained temperature. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet. Overall a good place to stay for business travellers.,"March 25, 2019"
"I've just returned from a lunch at Infinity at Crowne Plaza. If you're looking for advice before you to visit this place, here's mine - Don't.We were here for my brother's birthday celebration. We all ordered individual dishes along with non alcoholic drinks. Two of us ordered Cream of Tomato soups. It was need soup and more stale tomato puree with a touch of cream, grainy and with that tinge of staleness. The lemonade tasted of lime cordial and not fresh lemons.The worst was, when they asked us for feedback, and we gave them our opinion, they refused to accept it, saying it is not possible.I will obviously not go back here, and will of course suggest you don't go here either. I have a few discount vouchers for this place - they will stay unused.Also, I want to point out that though they claim to be an accessible hotel, my brother who is on a wheelchair had a tough time. There was no ramp to enter the premises, and the tables were designed most inconveniently.","March 23, 2019"
"We tried the coffee shop at Crowne plaza. Good ambience. Delicious & good no. of dishes on the buffet. Helpful, courteous support staff. Special mention for the mangers on duty Ratan and Narendra. Give the place a try ","March 23, 2019"
nicely done rooms. the breakfast spread was amazing and their eagerness to please you by accommodating special requests from the spread is worth mentioning. one downside was the room service. had ordered a pepper chicken & mix fried rice. could not figure out if i was served a pulao / biryani / fried rice. overall a comfortable stay.,"March 21, 2019"
"Had a great time at fitness center. The trainer was helpful and very informative. They are open 24 hrs and provide special access in after hours.The service in general is awesome including in room dining, guest services. Bhagwandas the gym trainer deserve special mention for great experience and helpful tips. ","March 21, 2019"
"Nice property, welcoming, good food. Offers awesome gym facility, steam and sauna.. Instructor bhagwan das was very helpful and knowledgeable. Pool looks neat and kept neat. House keeping is good too.","March 21, 2019"
"I stayed here for a couple of weeks on business in March before it started to get really hot. The hotel has 24hr security, good rooms, great staff and excellent food. I ate most of the time in the lounge bar so did not try the main restaurant, but the selection of food was excellent nevertheless. Well recommended!","March 19, 2019"
Recently we had the marriage event in Mayur Ball Room. We had booked the complete floor. Mr Nishant Narula had delivered the venue on time with committed deliverables and Chef Mr Shakti was tremondously good. Chef has come to take the feedback multiple times during the event. The food which was prepared for event was much much better than the food tasted at the time of food taste. Everyone praised for the food quality. The chaat prepartion should have been inside the floor reason being with few people takes the pain of going in the back where chaat stalls are there. In the front of the lift area also hotel has the space for chaat counters but the place is very smelly. The hotel staff is very transparent for counting of the plates placed in dining area. Overall management of the entire team was amazing. I would recommend this place for any event.,"March 16, 2019"
"Had my ring ceremony in Crowne Plaza, Mayur Vihar on 18th Feb, 2019 that was a gathering of 500 PaxIt was a memorable experience for me and my guests.Banquet service was very good and all the banquet arrangement s was really good. Special thanks to Mr Nishnat narula, Sales manager who made sure everything went smoothly and was always very helpful throughout the event starting from booking.I must say Mr Nishant Narula & Mr digambher are the great assets to the hotel.Would recommend crown plaza mayur vihar to everyone for a memorable experience","March 16, 2019"
Bhagwan Das was really helpful and made me stay active during the business trip. Hotel overall was a great experience.I would recommend this place for all business travellers to stay and keep yourself in the right environment,"March 13, 2019"
"Great hotel either for business or pleasure. Quality of the rooms is high, breakfast service is a bit chaotic but overall I would recommend. Pool is not heated so in March in the shade, the water is cold!","March 13, 2019"
"Stayed here after a budget hotel stay in old Delhi. Very nice change. The rooms were immaculate, big and comfortable. The lads in the bar are top notch, make an effort to make sure you’re happy and looked after. Also love a chat about sport. Definetly recommend if in need of a bit of luxury.","March 12, 2019"
"Stayed at this IHG property two times (total of seven & half nights) during a recent business trip to India. The location was particularly important for me as my work was in the NOIDA and Ghaziabad areas and Mayur Vihar was ideal to go to either place, considering the Delhi traffic .Made the booking on the IHG app (which works very well). Hotel management gave a discounted airport pick-up - thank you very much. Driver Ashok Yadav was courteous and a good conversationist.Akaash at the front desk ensured a smooth pick-up. The room was standard Crowne Plaza - good enough with a workable wi-fi. However, the bed mattress was not firm and felt worn out due to age. Bed-linen was okay but towels were pale and limp which was a disappointment.Buffet breakfast was very good. Chef Tarun gave personalized service and offered to prepare dishes which otherwise were not part of the spread.The gym was well-equipped and trainers on duty was polite and courteous.For the second stay, we got a room upgrade with the 14th floor Club Lounge access (due to my Gold status). However, the room was no different from the first one. Front desk agent could not explain why it was so. However, the Club Lounge was good though the food available there was somewhat cold (as it had to come from the main kitchen on the ground floor). Management could instal heating equipment to keep food warm. Staff was generally very good, friendly and polite and always ready to help. Overall, an excellent stay. Will surely return whenever in the area.","March 12, 2019"
Over all disappointed with the services of the hotel .I had booked for two nights initially and at the time of check in I was clearly told that I need to decide that moment only whether I am staying for one night or two nights . For which I told them that give me some time as I had a long day and I will let them know in some time but the attendant was adamant that I inform him that time only ..Over all staff was rude .Breakfast was okay .... They had goofed up in the invoice and I had told call them at least 40 times before I could get the invoice .M certainly not going back to the place ...It's been more than a month and they have not added my stay points in my IHG account .Thankfully I decided to stay for only one night ....,"March 9, 2019"
"It was my first time there.I liked the ambience, spacious rooms , good food .Location is a little deterent, but the transport is ample.One of the highlight of this hotel is their staff.A few people like Ajit , Nitin ( Break fast) are the guys who make you feel that you are staying in one of the best places..","March 9, 2019"
"My husband and I had a 2 night stay in this modern, stylish, appealing hotel. We had a large room, with extremely comfortable beds and pillows. It's perhaps one of the most comfortable beds that we've found in any hotel in which we've stayed. The staff were very friendly and efficient. There was a large selection of dishes in the dinner buffet, with choices of mild to hotter dishes, to suit everyone's palate, including the Western one. There was an extensive breakfast buffet as well. We found the hotel to be an oasis of calm from all the hectic traffic & activity outside the hotel perimeter. It's not in a location conducive to going for a stroll outside the hotel grounds. But once inside the gates, it was a wonderful place to stay and relax. There is a busy road next to it and also an above ground section of an underground line alongside the hotel, but we couldn't hear anything from our room. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","March 2, 2019"
Great hotelAway from the crowded area Very friendly staff and were willing to assist you with most things Facilities Galore Superb breakfast spread from continental to India Great value for moneyLoved the Stay,"March 1, 2019"
"Stayed 7 nights, the rooms were always clean and smelled great (also loved Bobby, you can see him in the picture attached), the personnel was super nice, and the restaurant has very tasty food (especially for breakfast). Last but not least, if you wish to stay in one night I recommend the lobby lounge for food and drinks - a big shout out to my favourite people working there - Ajay Negi, Lalit and especially Kamal","February 28, 2019"
"Holding our wedding at Crowne Plaza, Mayur Vihar was the best decision we made. We were sckeptical about this at first but the way Nishant and his team took us about the entire process, it felt absolutely hassle free and like a cake walk. Post our discussions and Nishant's hospitality at every visit ,we were rest assured that everything would just be in place and it was (infact even more) on the D day. I would like to thank Our star Chef - Mr. Sohail too who made the wedding meal the most delicious meal we all could ask for. The in-house decor team spearheaded by Ankit as on -point with all the decorations and made the entire venue look like no less than a dream! Thankyou Nishant and team for having made our day indeed the most beautiful day in our lives !","February 26, 2019"
"Room is quite good for a Small Family. I was here for 14 days. Everyone was very understanding . The Room service people especially Bobby was quite helpful and understanding. On the Dinning there are lots of helpful and friendly staff to start from Tarun the chef. Narendra and his boys Nitin, Aashis, Mohit, Akshay, Neeraj, Dinesh are all very understanding and helpful as well. They try to do the best inspite of all the guest. I don't rememer all the names but all of you were great , my aplology for forgetting your name. Thanks Rishi.","February 21, 2019"
"I stayed at this hotel during my recent business trip. I like the ambience and their spacious rooms. I have been to their gym every day and used to get some exercise. Instructor Bhagawan Das is a great guy - he used to teach simple to medium excercises for all body parts. Love going to the gym daily. In case you are staying at this hotel, strongly recommend visiting this gym.","February 19, 2019"
"Excellent team, nishant event handler cooperative personality and temperamentTheir panel members were amazing be it music by aman (karmaa) or decor by amit (Rustling leaves).Extremely happy with the experience.","February 18, 2019"
"The Hotel heavily advertises and pursues people to become a member of the Crystal Club but after becoming a member, the hotel has been less than helpful. For starters, nobody answers the calls on the designated number and when you call the hotel, they refuse to help as the Crystal Club membership is handled by a third party. I raised a request online and I have also made 20+ calls since morning to avail the complementary night stay in the coming week and nobody is responding. Would not recommend this membership to anyone.","February 18, 2019"
"Located convenient to downtown Delhi and a short distance from shopping areas, the Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar is a perfect option for business travellers to Delhi. The sous chef amazed me with his signature a la carte dishes made on demand. Staff were incredibly polite and helpful. Only bad points were due to a complete mess up on hotel car bookings but we'll forgive them that.","February 13, 2019"
It was good experience..all staff was cooperative and helpful..food was excellent..decoration was awsome..recommended for marriage and other functions..also for small family get togethers..timely rendering of services,"February 12, 2019"

"Sorry for writing little late!!!! We stayed during our SATTE visit for two days and the place is fantastic. Though the hotel was pack, the staff tried their level best to provide us with early check in. Front office staff were very helpful. Restaurant team is beyond my words. Escorting us till our table was really really sweet of them. Each and everyone made sure that we ate well. One day one since we were little unhappy as we had ordered for breakfast in our room, but tea and our breakfast was cold but I didnt wanted to make issue out of it as they had taken pain to allot us room but we received the call from hotel for the feedback and i shared my view and immediately hotel staff apologized and informed me that they are sending Cappuccino for us, we didnt take it though but i really appreciated their efforts. All in All we are super happy with the team of Crowne Plaza. Cheers to entire team, keep up the good work guys:)","February 8, 2019"
"We had a lovely stay at the Crowne Plaza - the room was lovely with, quite possibly, the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in! I never wanted to get out of it!The staff were very attentive and friendly. They seemed genuinely interested in our trip and what we had planned.The only slight minus is that it was a bit further out of “downtown” Delhi than we realised, but with taxis at very reasonable prices it wasn’t too much of a problem!Definitely would recommend highly and would stay there again in a flash!","February 8, 2019"
Stayed here from 6th to 9th feb. Liked the overall service of the hotel and services. Specially Mohit was very good in his services in club lounge. Divyansh from sales and marketing -we had a good chat in club lounge during interaction.,"February 8, 2019"

"We took a great room rate which included executive room, breakfast, club lounge and airport transfer. Our room was really spacious and comfortable. The buffet breakfast is excellent and all the food and water is safe for Westerners. The club lounge is worth having - there is a good range of wines and spirits and we ate there every evening. The server there, Mohit is very friendly and attentive - he looked after us really well, pouring our drinks as soon as he saw us walk through the door.","February 2, 2019"
"I wanted to give the place Excellent Rating. As the stay and the service are to the Top Notch Level. The only thing why I gave them Very Good Rating is due to the Breakfast options & Food taste in General. The Housekeeping Person Named SUNIL CHAUHAN was excellent with providing timely services, where n when required.Thankyou to the staff n special Thanks Sunil & Himani from Housekeeping for making my Stay very confortable. I would surely recommend this property to everyone who want spacious Rooms with excellent services n Good Food.","February 2, 2019"
Everyone at this hotel is amazing and super helpful.Kamal takes care of everything you need in the lobby bar Rooms are amazing and the blackout curtains are the best. Breakfast has many options...and all are good!,"February 2, 2019"
This is my favorite place to spend time when I'm out of the office. The lobby lounge has a great atmosphere and even better selection. The staff is always very helpful and willing to go the extra mile. Especially Kamal in the lobby lounge.,"February 2, 2019"

Having visited this hotel on many occasions it continues to stand up to the high expectations. Service levels are fantastic and the team cannot do enough for you. Kamal at the lobby lounge has been a great host throughout my stay and Manoj at the entrance always greets you with a smile. This hotel will continue to be my go to place in Noida for business trips. ,"January 30, 2019"

"I had kolkata Frankie roll. They were excellent, service by Kamal!Had couple of beers. I visit here often.They offer good place to relax and enjoy!Visited Elle Spa also, they do good massage.Worth taking membership.","January 28, 2019"
"Was here for a corporate training program as guest facilitator, Liked the room and food was good. Its tough being Vegan but the Chef on call did manage to get my Flaxseed ready for lunch. Almost all dishes were full of cream ad dairy products, even the Veg salad had Cheese and Mayo mixed.The staff was superhelpfull in dining, room service as well as Banquet.I will recommend this to any one having work on this side of the town. Going to main Delhi may take an hour.A big plus for people who like to buy their liquor outside is the Mall behind hotel which has just wine shops :), one also gets spicy tidbits which goes with Drinks.","January 27, 2019"
The rooms are spacious and modern. Hotel Staff very attentive. Restaurant food and staff were the best. Enjoyed dinning with them every breakfast and diner during my stay. Hats off to the wait staff and the cooks - bravo!,"January 26, 2019"

"Amazing service from the moment we stepped into the hotel. The staff in the lobby lounge were engaging and talkative, quickly learning my favourite drinks and educating us on Indian language and culture. Special mention to Kamal, Ajay and their supervisor Lalit for going above and beyond each and every night.","January 24, 2019"
"Very good service in the hotel. Kindly received in the lobby lounge by Kamal, Ajay Negi and Lalit who served us excellently. Highly recommend this hotel to any guest to feel right at home. The standards of the rooms and the food in the restaurant are of good quality. ","January 23, 2019"
"We absolutely loved the spa/massage experience. The room was lovely, the shower area relaxing and the personal massage individual was very professional. The bedding was soft, clean and comfortable. The bathrooms were clean & well maintained. The morning breakfast buffet was our favorite part of the hotel. The management, food flavors, drink options and mix of local & international cuisine was perfect! Typical Indian attentiveness was refreshing. The front desk arranged a day tour of downtown for us-with a driver who spoke great English & also had free wifi from the hotel available for us. We had a wonderful experience.","January 23, 2019"
The buffet breakfast and dinner are very sumptuous and with a wide variety of choices.The rooms are spacious and well maintained.Things worth Special mention is the Health club and the staff. Satya - the gym instructor was very helpful did a great job helping and guiding ,"January 22, 2019"
"We use this hotel for our regular business trip. The staff is excellent and always attentive to our needs, sometimes I feel why are they soo customer focused :-p The breakfast staff, the housekeeping, the front desk and our gym instructor Bhagwan (yes, that’s what his name is!) are always attentive and focused. Thanks to Crowne Plaza I have gotten back to my habit of going to the gym every morning (isn’t that something!). So looking forward to my follow up visits.","January 22, 2019"
"Staying for business purposes at the Crowne Plaza.So far having a good time at hotel, very clean - unfortunately the pool is closed and my non-smoking room smells of cigarettes... But that's my only moan.I will review again when I leave.Kamal has been great and very helpful/attentive in the lobby bar.Mohit in the club lounge gave us a great welcome and was also a superb host.","January 22, 2019"
"Wow food was amazing especially the paneer. Kamal served us all night and was friendly, attentive and had a great sense of humour, well worth a visit all of the staff are so friendly. Sadly the pool was closed but it’s a great hotel.","January 22, 2019"
"It is matter of great happiness I chose this property to hold and host the wedding ceremony of my daughter on 17th January, 2019.The professional approach with personal touch & warmth was provided by Mr. Nishant Narula who involved himself with this event as a family member. He has been very very courteous every time he was approached for any small or big thing. Very pleasing personality.Head chef Mr. Shakti has been very kind to suggest the nitty-gritty of the menu. He is an expert to understand type of food we would need and suggest even the spices. Chef Shakti was present to personally supervise the dinner function and oversee everything goes well. Food was excellent. What a personal touch !! Mr. Nishant Narula & Chef Shakti are the great assets to the hotel.Mr. Digamber took over the entire process for smooth coordination and execution during the whole night-thru' event, with big smile. He provided everything that was asked in a very short time. What a back-up support !! Commendable indeed !!Mr. Lalit provided the floral decor. He is very mature & calm person. He understood our requirement very well. Stage, entry gate, photo-booth all floral decor & ambiance has been a great visual delight. He was able to execute our imagination into reality. He did a commendable job.Security in-charge Mr. Praveen Sehrawat provided close watch on all round security aspects during the entire event. Superb!!To top-up the pleasure, The General Manager of the Hotel Mrs. Nivedita Avasthi came to see the arrangements herself during the day, to ensure the function goes well. My full appreciation to the management.ALL MY GUESTS HAVE NOT ONLY GONE VERY HAPPY BUT ALSO HAVE GIVEN THEIR FEEDBACK OF THE EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENTS & SUMPTUOUS FOOD.WHAT A PLEASANT ALL ROUND EXPERIENCE, CONVERTED INTO A GREAT MEMOIR !!","January 21, 2019"
Stayed at Hyatt regency. Very dull experience. Crowne Plaza on the other hand was wonderful. Staff showed great attention to detail. Bhagawan Das in Gym area showed around all the amenities and made experience comfortable. Highly recommend.,"January 19, 2019"
"Dear GM!As a Group GM of a couple of resorts in Thailand, it is always a pleasure to compliment other hotels on their top class service.Your team members are incredible. The standard of service which my colleague and i received was top class...I have to mention a few team members particularly:1. Kamal @ the Lobby Lounge. Oh what a joy to be served by Kamal. He remembered our favourites each night; up sold extremely well and a great smiler and a real smother!!! thanks for the laugh Kamal.2. Asha, Akshay and 'Im training' (who worked with Akshay) were out of this world. They recommended dishes each night we enjoyed your buffet and kept bringing India things to try... amazing standard of service and again at breakfast they did the same all over again. A credit to your team! There was also one other taller guy (sorry i couldnt catch his name badge) too with them and..... 3. Lalit - Well a true gentleman and wow he organised his team well. Slick, professional and extremely observant every meal which is wonderful to see in hotel operations.4. Mr. Narendra the Restuarant Manager. What a joy of a person to welcome and look after guests.... a pleasure to meet with him5. Chef Suchel (?) during dinner was so attentive and came to chat with every table to make sure all was ok..6 Sadly, i didnt catch the lovely Chef in the morning's name who can and made sure that EVERYTHING was good on his buffet. A very proud Chef and wow his team was slick and well ordered .. delightful gentleman....7. Bobby our Room Attendant and his daily towel design of swans. Perfect cleaning every day and his attention to details in the guests room was impeccable..... Cleanliness of guests rooms get 100% from us both!8. Ajit (?) - Head Concierge = an Ambassador for your hotel... Truly friendly and knowledgable and there to help at all hours... Wonderful to have met you.. Thank you.9. Raman Chakute (Duty Manager) who i think was the gentleman who met us at 1am after a rather tedious journey in which we had to wait for luggage the airport for over 70 minutes but he offered the perfect welcome after finally getting to your hotel.Now, readers might think, well, we should expect such excellent service, but believe me, Corporate Hotels dont always have so much time to take care of guests and chat with them as they operation is always so busy. Resort hotels then yes, we expect this...GM it was a pleasure to stay at your hotel and i really hope that my next trips to India allow me to stay here again...With extremely grateful thanks for the PERFECT stay...M C H (504).","January 18, 2019"
"Such amazing service....and helpful support by team.Special thanks to Latika for being so amazing for any help or her hospitality.She was a call away for any problem and was there present always around us to help.Kudos to the team, waiting for more to come and execute together.","January 17, 2019"
"During my stay the following team members made me feel really at home.1) The chef brigade provided the most remarkable experience to me this time. Chef Suhel, Chef Manjit and Chef Tarun were all outstanding. They know my taste really well and created dishes just to meet my expectations. Perhaps the ‘ ‘hero’ amongst all of them was the ‘Bajre Ka Khichdi’ - which I had for most of my dinners. My special thanks to Chef Shakti and Chef Diwas to take personal care of me- their leadership of the kitchen team is remarkable. Kindly thank Chef Raja too for his South Indian breakfast delicacies.2) Sunil from Laundry was such a disciplined soldier. The attention and care with which he came and placed my laundry every evening in my room was noteworthy. Sometimes I would be on a client call and he would discreetly Open my room and do the needful. Very professional of him.3) Amit from the IHG Loyalty club was a friend in need for me. He sorted out a lot of my pending queries for me.4) Sumit from IRD was another great soldier - silent, smooth and disciplined. Great guy. So was Narinder.5) Devendra, Ajit and Ankit always treat me like family. Amazing set of people- always smiling and ready to serve everyone with a smile. Avinash is another great guy in your from office department.6) The Infinity Service team had a lot of new faces this time. It was great to see Ratan in a managers uniform and for Asha to move over from the hostess to the service team- very well deserved. Nitin, Madhuban, Manisha, Dolly, Mohit, Gokul, Akshay are all very smart and guest centric. They all have a great leader in Narender- who is always very humble and leads from the front.7) Chauffeur Ranjit who dropped me at the airport today and Manoj Yadav in security. My special thanks to your head of security too who can and met me in person twice. My apologies for not remembering his name clearly. 8) And, finally I Grad Akshad. I wish his all the best for his next journey as he passes out of his MT Program.Please do let the above team members know that I am grateful to each one of them and to anyone else whom I may have missed unintentionally.","January 17, 2019"
Breakfast was very good. Just wanted to add if you can extend a section of seasonal fruits and put only fruits which are seasonal during the period.Had a great experience and the people were extremely helpful specially Latika Arora and Vaibhav helped us a lot during our visit and helped us manage an event successfully.,"January 16, 2019"
"This is my second stay at this place which was about 35 days Long.Having treated very well during my Last Trip to Delhi i choose to stay again here without any second thoughts.Checkin started on a sore note and might not me the best experience and i personally believe it could have been better.I expressed my requirements of specific bed and pillow type and was taken care well.Then there comes my favourite part of the day,getting treated to drinks over a nice view from 14th Floor which i really loved.Day starts with a wide range of breakfast ,staying away from India craves me to have typical home style Breakfast and i must say Paranthas and Pickles were one of the best i ever Had.This place is very well managed special mention to their Superstar Mr Narendar who is always on his toes and makes sure you leave the restaurant with filled heart and Tummy.Chef Tarun visits you on Table to ask for your hidden wishes and treated me with Malabari Parantha and Egg curry whose taste is still fresh in my Mouth.Lunch and Dinner Buffet are served with variety of choices and they are always ready to travel that extra mile if you have special demands.Due to odd working hours i ended with room dining which was good as well.I raised my concern and requested for some changes in snacks served in Lounge which was taken care well beyond my expectations.Their Exec Chef Mr Diwas personally visited me to ensure my request is being taken care off.This Hospitality really won me over.To add further staff responsible for managing Lounge Mr Mohit is very dedicated to maintain high service standards and ensures top notch service.Fitness area is also very well maintained with very well appointed trainers to take care of the facility.I do had my share of complaints and hiccups but i observed that Team was willing to listen and to do best to ensure a comfortable stay,thats all that does matters for a stay,special mention to Mr Chandra and Mr Vaibhav.People of this place makes it one of the best place to stay in Delhi,express your needs and they do listen to you.","January 16, 2019"
"Very well maintained property and very well located as well.Its a Must vist place for Business as well as leaisure if your are planning south Delhi and Noida. Food in its infinity restraunt is awesome, especially restraunt service people are too good and they will surely make you are fed well with all the delicasies of the day :). I remember Mohit and Tarun being so gentle and caring in serving that i would must say its a best thing next to home caring. I would advise to opt for back side akshardham fascing view room else you will not find front room view not that good due to obvious factor as its overlooking Mayuur vihar residential society. Net Net to conclude. Its a must visit place and if you are there the buffet lunch/dinner is the best thing to enjoy there. Just forget diet plan and enjoy the wonderland - food and great stay. Cheers !","January 16, 2019"
"F&B good, Front Office very very bad...Started with the stench when you get out of the car (but that is nothing the hotel can do, but it just mar your first impression), and my suitcase was put through the metal detector and waist level...came out on the inside of the hotel and there was no one to help me bring it down - all 23 kg of it...someone only came running after I struggled and brought it down myself. And from then on it was one disappointment after another. I can accept that hardware may be something that the hotel cannot do much about, but the staff...they seriously need training! They do not empathize with the guest and only have a very micro view of the world out there and how people conduct their business, and many of them I spoke to paid only lip service to give you the impression of great service and that they are listening, but fail to deliver...Will never want to stay there again","January 15, 2019"
"Visited for a business venture, 2 days long activity.Well maintained property.Have 14 floors.Very nice conference Halls with modular partitions. Can be used as per capacity.Ambience is very nice.Free Vallet Parking.Food is just OK, not bad.Near to Akshar Dhaam metro station and DND flyover.","January 15, 2019"
"Stayed for 7 days, its was comfortable, food at infinity is great..!!Special thanks to Dinesh, for his service. Would recommend him as a star though rest of the staff were also amazing. Though hotel reception needs to learn about treating the customer instead of talking bluntly about guest stay.If you are planning for guest to stay kindly confirm the same at reception by 6:00 PM, else they will charge you double of stay. Seems more of a warning, as if we are stealing something from hotel.This is the most ridiculous thing I heard here, after staying in multiple hotels. Reducing one star for same reason..!!","January 15, 2019"

"We stayed there for total 3 nights, room size and its decor, interior design is fantastic. We had given 10th Floor room, the view from room was amazing, the staff of the hotel - from security ro reception and reastaurant- all are welcoming eith smile, friendly and helpful. The swimming pool was not covered and it has no temperature control water system, hence we couldn't use it. The cleaning standard is satisfactory but housekeeping team need a little more improvement. Just a few hours before our international check out, there was a problem with regard to water pressure in the shower that couldn't fixed in time. The Reastaurant staff, Mr Narendra, his chef team and in particular Akshay, Nitin and Dinesh were very friendly, helpful and accommodating our special requests . Overall stay was very pleasent. We would highly recommend this hotel. Just bear in the mind, tge airport is not 12 minutes far as it is mentioned here, it is 1.5 hours approximately due to unsystemic traffic of New Delhi. More Indian Vegetarian dishes could be offered.","December 28, 2018"
Mr bhagwan dass at the health club was excellent with his services .... he was very warm and carried out his duties diligently... excellent staff here . The food here was also super good and the restaurant waiters were also efficient and swift with their services ... I look forward to my trip at crown plaza in the future too ... kudos to the management!,"December 28, 2018"
"It seems to be ""normal"" at Indian hotels that their employees ask you for a positive review here on TripAdvisor ! During our trip to India we were staying at four different hotels and it happened at ALL of them !So, if the reviews mention any particular employees name then ..... well they have beefed the guest for that particular review. Maybe they were promised some kind of reward.That said the Crown Plaza in Delhi is definitely great with excellent service, great food and a nice room.","December 27, 2018"
Crowne Plaza at Noida is an excellent hotel for the business as well as pleasure trip It has all kinds of room categories starting from single deluxe AC through Suite rooms the cost of Hotel is reasonable and affordable looking at the tariff I would say that it is value for money people who travel for either business or pleasure trip Plaza is equipped with beautiful restaurant I like the restaurant very well the food quality is superb and I am sure that everyone would like it we want this it has a bar available for guest visiting to Crowne Plaza the location of Hotel is in Greater Noida and surrounded by industry so people visiting for a business having their offices in Noida Greater Noida and around it is a great place to stay the downside is that in case if you would like to have your dinner outside the Hotel Crowne Plaza you may not find multiple options restaurant outside the hotel at walking distance also please note that the car services offered by Crowne Plaza is bit expensive compared to ola and uber I would recommend to use ola or Uber if it works for you as what the radio taxis easily available on demand Have a great Experience At Crowne Plaza thank you,"December 26, 2018"

There’s a positive energy and everyone has a smile. Very welcoming. The food is amazing. It’s not the typical hotel food. It’s actually fresh and well made. All in all a great hotel but what makes it a killer deal for me is the gym and the pool. Here’s why :1. Bhagwan Das is an amazing instructor always correcting postures and eager to help. 2. The equipment is clean , new, and well managed. Kudos to Mr Balwant. 3. The pool is clean and 25 mtrs which is great for a lap swim.","December 16, 2018"

The staff set this hotel apart, and a special mention to Mohit in the Executive Lounge, who’s attention to detail was outstanding. Knowing my food preferences he went out of his way to find a solution each evening. The hotel itself is clean, modern and conveniently placed for business meetings in the area. Additionally about 15 minutes from NZM station for the train to Agra. I would highly recommend this property and will certainly be returning. ","December 10, 2018"

"Originally booked Sept. 21 - 28. Immediately realized that I would lose a day flying there and modified my reservation to Sep 22-28. Even called the hotel to verify the modification. When I checked out, they charged me for the extra day. I got home and emailed the hotel. They showed me the original reservation and said that was why they charged me. I told them I had a modified reservation and showed it to them. They wouldn't listen. IHG said it was out of their hands and credit card company couldn't do anything either. The place is in the middle of nowhere. They told me not to go off hotel grounds when I said I wanted to go for a walk after dinner.I happened to be in the room one day when they changed the bedding. You really wouldn't want to see the stains on the mattress that were there.The restaurant was very good as was most of the service except for billing.","November 23, 2018"

"After 4 mounth of bagpacking in India i decided to end my trip in good hotel. I booked 2 nights in Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida without knowing or expecting too much. But the moment i walked through the hotel's gate i knew i made the right decision. The staff In the hotel's gate, in the hotel's door, in the lobby, in the resturant- everybody were so welcoming, smiling and super nice. The room was very clean and big, every little detail is for the benefit of the guests. And when i tought it cant get better than this, in the (exellent) breakfast the waiter did a small and unintentional mistake. He and the staff, especially the manager, couldn't be more sorry and haven't stpped to apologize and compensate me in many ways. I was so suprised and exited that i forgot to take their names, and i am sorry for that. So please accept my sincere gratitued. Thank you so much!

After a day long meetings, headed to the gym and was happy to see state of art equipment and an enthusiastic trainer Bhagwan Das. He just motivates the people walking into the gym and helps with getting great workouts and stretches done. Food served is fantastic and you can find good variety, however you would have to choose between buffet at Inifinity or the cafe lounge. Not many options for restaurants but the staff is proactive. They are happy to help you with anything that you need. Although it does come at a price but with all that this place has to offer, I would say it is worth the money spent. Cheers","November 20, 2018"

"Am I too old to say OMG!?The second visit to Hote1 Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida and I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Not sure that there is anything else to say that hasn’t already be said. This place is simply perfect. Yes, it is worth every single penny because of the way you are treated and the attention to detail that is given to every aspect of the visit. My suggestion is as follows. Stop reading the reviews and just book. Go! Take the significant other in your life, pack a bag and get there. Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida. Biggest asset is the team Thank you for making me feel at home in Delhi. Everything about Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida is excellent, although your biggest asset is your team. I can’t say enough about each and every one of those men and women …..) Who took care of me. The staff is extremely friendly, the restaurant very flexible (appreciate this!) and the restaurant supervisors and chefs are ((Ratan, Deepak, Mohit, Narendra, Hoshiyar…..) deserves a special thanks. I had two great evenings here, which obviously also added up to the experience. I had a problem adjusting my sleep and used to spend many late hours. Someone always made sure that I was comfortable. Our big thank you to all of you and bravo! for maintaining the highest standards of excellence in hospitality. SublimeIt's hard to know where to begin with this review. With a heavy heart, I have just returned back to the 'real world' of my own home and the daily grind of real life and work. I'm reflecting so fondly over the last 24 hours during my all too brief stay at Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida.I also wanted to take away the soft fluffy towels. And the sheets. And even just one of the pillows from the huge pillow menu. And the robes. And the slippers. And even the unique piped fragrance throughout the hotel. I wanted it all to take home with me to remind me of my time here. But I didn't take anything away apart from an incredible experience and a sense of real honor that I've had the privilege of staying here. From the moment I walked in the door, I made to feel special. I want to go back. And soon. I almost don't want to give everything away in this review so that upcoming guests can be surprised by what they find when they stay, so I will try to keep things brief and as understated as I can but I really want to shout it out to the world as it's been so good! I met with a very friendly warm welcome. I were shown to the Executive Lounge for a seamless check-in and then taken to our room. Wow. Room 1223 was on the 12th floor. I continued to discover all sorts of surprises in the room a pet menu and all sorts of things to keep happy. It's so hard to put into words. The attention to detail, however, Room was incredible. Nothing seemed too much trouble. The staff is impeccably well trained and presented: they all strike just the right balance of being unobtrusive yet friendly, attentive and familiar all at the same time. Guests are made to feel like they're part of an exclusive (yet approachable and unintimidating) club. Breakfast was lovely and I dined in INFINITY for dinner (again also great and welcoming). This is most definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I completely understand why it is reviewed so favorably by so many. It is unique and has a personal touch that I have not often found in many larger establishments. I sad to leave today and we can't wait to return. Thank you so much Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida for a really memorable stay and a huge thank you to all the staff who made it so special for me. Best serviceThis is without a doubt the best service I have received in any hotel in India. The attention to detail and thoughtfulness of the staff and management is indeed inspiring. My brother-in-law runs a business with 100+ people and I know how hard you have to work to meet such high standards. Well done and thank you!!Most memorable HotelStaying Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida has been a wonderful experience and our most memorable Hotel stay thus far. If ever I return to Delhi, Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar Noida will surely be our first choice for accommodation. I would very much like to thank the staff for all they have done to make my time here comfortable and relaxing. Perfection!Everything was perfection! I will be staying here again if I'm lucky enough to come back to Delhi. Every member of your staff was above excellent! Exceeded our expectations Once again you have exceeded our expectations from the moment I stepped through the door. I can’t think of anything you could do to improve – thank you!","November 11, 2018"

Business trip - first time in India. Delhi traffic incredibly busy so allow extra time for everything and be prepared for Smog in cooler months.Modern business oriented hotel with spacious rooms and good food. A la Carte better than buffet. Best thing about the hotel is the attentive staff from Bobby Singh (maid service) to food waiters. They work hard and can’t do enough for guests after hard day at work and fighting through congestion.Recommend this oasis of calm. One downside - room rate reasonable but drinks etc very expensive.,"October 25, 2018"

He is very helpful and guided the way to gym as per my physic.He is very calm and patient in teaching. I have been going to the gym for last few days during my stay at crown plaza and found all facilities are well maintained,"September 5, 2018"
"Location is at the border of Delhi and Noida and we had work in both places so ideal location for us. Smooth check in. Being Platinum member , upgraded to Club room ( without club lounge facilities ) and the Room was much bigger than all usual similar Rooms I stayed in Delhi. It was top floor so called Pool view room but the Pool was hardly visible from there ( due to height I feel ).Spa was having some promotional discounts but felt to be a little expensive in spite of discounts. Though service , massage rooms and massage was really good.Breakfast was good , specially Idlis and sweet Lassi.No Pastry Shop inside the Hotel was a little disappointment. We went to adjacent Holiday Inn to buy Pastries.Overall a very good stay and will stay again if want to stay around that area.","September 4, 2018"
The hotel is beside Holiday Inn. When I asked what’s the main difference the front desk proudly declared they are 5stars while Holiday Inn is 4. Taking pride of his workplace.The hotel facilities is pretty decent with a big Gym and a outdoor pool.Breakfast however is a bit slow on the order. I was rushing for time and they took Loke over 10mins to do my eggs and juice.Room is big and cosy. Only complain is the TV. For some reason I cannot adjust the volume and cannot totally off it. There were no instructions and for 2 nights I sleep with the TV on (off the setup box)!I believe there might be a TV remote but it’s just not there.Overall a good hotel.,"September 4, 2018"
"It’s such a nice place & amazing staff...... we used to stayed here quite Often & always feels pleaser to come here..... all staff is fully trained and they know what they are doing in such a hospitality manner ..... specially thanks to Cheff Deepak, Ms. Asha, Mr. Gokul who has made our stay this much memorable!!’Wishing all the great success and happiness to the entire Crown Plaza Family!!Lots of love ","September 1, 2018"

Feeling so much good ,if I got again chance to come in this city then I must again come this hotel.","September 1, 2018"
"It is often said that the people working on the shop floor in the organisation are the real ambassadors of that company. i am the first hand witness of that. When you enter Infinity, the all day dining restaurant at Crowne Plaza Mayur vihar, you would feel that there is a dearth of dining options in the hotel but a couple of minutes spent inside the restaurant will turn it into a myth. There is plenty of energy inside right through the hostess desk to the server on the table to the chefs preparing Live delicacies. Being from the same industry, I can understand the WOW factor hotels try to create in front of the guest but a very few manage to achieve them. Chef Shakti and Nitin Rana (server) were absolutely swashbuckling performers for me that evening. I did not have to get off my table for anything. Such was the initiative by the team to make me feel special as it was my son's birthday that I thought I was celebrating it at home. Wonderful food, interactive server, nice mocktail and an absolutely stunning climactic plate of desserts was enough to make my evening very very special. Thanks a lot for the hospitality Ms. Awasthi (General Manager). I am sure this has flowed down through you. All I can say is that please keep the team motivated so that they keep excelling in their fields. Thanks again for the Xprerience.","August 30, 2018"
Had a fantastic stay. I visit regularly for stays and this hotel is very relaxed and enjoyable to stay in. Staff is very polite and helpful. Specially Devender at the reception counter. No uneccessary hassles. Loved it.- Kumar Parashar,"August 30, 2018"
"This is my second time to stay in Crowne Plaza and in both occassions, their Service is topnotch and consistent. They even knew who I had breakfast with the previous days and suggested a table that will fit all of us even if I came down on my own.Requests were provided in a timely manner and done with a smile. I hope they keep it up.","August 30, 2018"
"Been here many a times but trust me every single time dey had ensured dat all my needs have been looked after.... Location can be a setback.. But thw services and food really makes u feel spl and does the magic of not thinking bout ""strategically placed"" hotel... Have seen the hotel changing hands too.. But the way IHG has been handling the people is far better than thr counterparts...Buffet was almost perfect... Good selection of items less of repetitive.. Attention was given to every single table inspite being a full house.. Kudos to the team for that.. Few gems really stand apart mohan ratan nitin... Man u guys rock.. U were like the avengers of the fnbworld... Great job wud love to come again... This place really needs a good fine dine place to complete the feel..","August 29, 2018"

"Hello..i'm Aishwarya -a member of the gym and pool in this property.I would particularly mention about Rahul, he is a great swimming coach and motivator. He has that knack of pushing you to do better and achieve your target. It's an absolute bliss to have a trainer like Rahul.I would also want to add a few words about Lata. She takes special interest amd understands the fitness goals of every member and makes a plan and helps us execute. She's an absolute star. An excellent gym trainer. I highly recommend.","August 28, 2018"
The hotel is good. The service is excellent and especially worth mentioning is Mr Ratan from the Infinity Restaurant who has gone to extreme lengths to take excellent care of the guests.Many hotels can learn from the excellent service provided by this hotel,"August 27, 2018"

"This hotel has gone from good to average to terrible. They run a membership scam called crystal club which is apparently not by IHG. Scam you into fake privileges, don't give membership benefits like room booking or beverages and say these are their internal rules which of course customers are not told or aware of. No escalation works, staff is inconsiderate and helpless. don't be fooled by crystal club scam.","August 24, 2018"
"The stay was fantastic with very good facilities. Great gym with helpful trainers like Bhagwan Das, nice swimming pool. Kids enjoyed the stay with beautiful reception and large variety of food items..","August 23, 2018"
"Crowne Plaza is a vertical wonder with fourteen floors worth of luxury.The check-in process was smooth though we reached the hotel late evening. We were taken to our room as the staff willingly took care of our 6-8 shopping bags that we had just invested our time and money in.The rooms are luxurious with every amenities that you could ask for, available for you. The washroom includes a bathtub, rain-shower but the toilet is proper American Style so only tissues available.The view of the city from the 14th floor non-smoking room was spectacular. From slippers to umbrellas, everything was available in the cupboard.The mini-bar was stuffed though I did not even touch it after seeing the exuberant prices of the drinks and snacks.The swimming pool on the third floor was a delight. It is well maintained and faces the gym.Finally, the buffet breakfast spread was a luxurious affair. The options are enough to fill you even till after lunch hours.In totality, Crowne Plaza was a great experience for me and I couldn't find any area where I would want to make a complain or crib.Yes, the place is a bit costly but the service and the amenities make it worth the money.","August 20, 2018"
"It's a good hotel located conveniently near to noida and akshardham. Nice pool with a view of metro and well equipped gym. Rooms are large and well appointed and room service is prompt. Courteous staff, especially Bhagwan Das is a nice and helpful instructor. ","August 19, 2018"
"We stayed in this hotel for one night, basically to see the famous Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple near Mayur Vihar. Very affordable and clean hotel. Good service in their restaurant. Chef Sohail Ahmed was exceptionally kind and catered to our special food requests, for dinner, with a warm smile. This hotel is very close to Metro lines (na done can hear the noise of Metro trains rumbling zipping past the hotel. Great views from hotel Windows.Very good Gym. Had a good workout (we cleaned the treadmills and the other equipment we used, ourselves, both before and after the use - to maintain basic hygiene, a little detail seemed to be missing here).Overall good value for money.

Nice gym with a good instructor (Bhagwan Das) !! Courteous staff with big spacious rooms. Breakfast had a good spread. Stayed for a day on a business trip. Will visit again. Very close to Noida’s offices. ,"August 6, 2018"
"Concierge - Their concierge staff is the worst and they are liars. They have no regard of people's time. I had booked cab for pickup from my office at 8.15 PM but the cab reached us after 9. They lied to us that the cab is stuck in traffic but there was no traffic on roads. This was the 3rd time that they have sent cab late but given an excuse about traffic. They put me on hold for more than 10 mins and dont even give an update.Restaurant - Good service, the waiters are very friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet has a good spread with variety. if they have time, the presentation of food is also done well. We love the mocktails made by Sanjay. Ratan is always so helpful and does the best food presentations.Gym - They have an excellent gym with all the amenities with pool view. Their trainer Bhagwan Das is very good and helpful.Housekeeping - Room and bathroom is always clean and tidy. Any food ordered in room is always on time.","August 6, 2018"
"Excellent hotel close to our Noida office and well located on the main road. Room was comfortable, check in was smooth, Dinner at next door holiday Inn (Part of same chain I believe) was superb and next day morning breakfast was the most awesome I have ever had. Only recommendation is that I had bad stomach at night for something I had earlier elsewhere, we called reception and they were not very helpful with simple medicines (pain killers). I guess this is something every hotel could do better (Keep some basic OTC medicine in stock in case any guest wants it).","July 31, 2018"
"Although I met some problems at the beginning of my stay, Its so patiently helped me by two on-site supervisors Amit&Raman. Helped me with the problem. Its very good service. Thank you to the Crowne plaza professional service team. The hotel is very convenient near the subway station. And Breakfast is 100 % in quality.","July 30, 2018"
"The restaurant Infinity is on the ground floor of Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar. Soft colours, high ceilings, clean lines and no particular regional décor made it indeed a neutral space to enjoy a meal. Also, we found the waiters friendly and accommodating. The starters involving fried shrimps and spring rolls in Indonesian style had fair amount of spices. A very good thing about all the dishes was that they came with a serving of salad and sambal – a hot relish made from a variety of ingredients. This helped to balance the taste, flavour and nutrition in the dish.The main course comprised of pan-seared sole and mee goreng, fried rice with South Asian twist. The fried fish was a piece of beauty. It had been seared to perfection and the crispy skin added to the texture. This dish in our opinion was the king.The dessert was black bean pudding. The whole desert was a new explosion of tastes in our mouth. The bean pudding, in a beautiful shade of violet, was little hard and we could feel the texture in our mouth. This dessert was on the whole mild and sat very well after the heavy dinner.Talking about desserts, we could not resist and tasted some items from their regular buffet. The caramel pudding with its egg-butter fused flavours, was a hero and so were the dry cakes. We finished our dinner with coffee. Do try their cappuccino and latte. Our experience with coffee at five stars hasn’t been too great but the fantastic coffee was a pleasant surprise. The caffeine kick was bang on with just the necessary kick we needed for the long drive back home.","July 27, 2018"
"I really liked the hotel. Was here for 2 weeks on business trip. This hotel is made for people on business trips. Rooms are spacious with a separate work area. Bathrooms are provided with hot tubs.The distinction of this hotel compared to others is the courteous staff always smiling and greeting you. Also, the care taken by hotel to ensure that your stay is comfortable in every manner. In fact I got to order food of my choice outside the menu many times. Was also invited to hotel's monthly gala where staff interacts with you to get to know more of you; of course free drinks and food provided in gala :D.Overall loved the stay here. Nice location, fantastic facilities ( gym, swimming pool, restaurants etc) and a good staff.A warm thanks to the hotel staff for making my stay memorable. Keep up the good work.Special thanks to Mr Vaibhav Sharma, Sales Manager for being so nice and caring and making us part of Crowne Plaza family.RegardsChetan Goyal","July 27, 2018"

We are the Crystal Club members of this hotel In mayur vihar ...we were out with our friends on a Saturday night ....Had their voucher which we wanted to use ...The bartender insisted that we hand over the entire booklet to him and he will remove the valid coupons himself ... later on after coming back home I realized that very cleverly they had removed the free night stay Coupon from the booklet ..I reported this to the concerned authorities...spoken to sandeep the Crystal Club manager ...written mails ...spoke to the team in Bangalore..but in vain They have cheated us and have stopped taking calls....Disgusting ....not body should fall in this trap and buy their membership of the substandard hotel ...,"May 28, 2018"

The hotel is situated near mayur vihar extension so you are well connected with rest of delhi from metro 20 inr would.suffice to reach this hotel.The main attraction is very spacious rooms cozy bed &very nice ambience.In room dinning is very good however the.prices are on higher side i would suggest you people to reduce the prices of the menu.I could.not visit the pool situated at 2nd floor but for next time will surely go there.I really liked the.minute details in which hotel has thinked about the needs of guest. This hotel really deserves the 5 star rating.,"May 11, 2018"
"Never feel not in home. My 15 days staying in this hotel along with my family is an excellent experience, hospitality here is unprecedented. I could establish my son's schooling in a nearby school staying in this hotel after reaching here on transfer from Assam and I shall be indebted to all the staff working here, the way they helped and cooperated me. Chef Deepak is the best chef ever I have seen. His humble nature I shall never forget and would like to stay connected even after leaving Crowne Plaza. Mr. Narendra is an excellent manager.We never get bored in food during my long 15 days staying here. Chefs always try to change menu with always tasty items.Rooms are very comfortable, housekeeping is excellent. I found every thing good starting from food, rooms, swimming pool, Gym. For me, Crowne Plaza means the best Hotel in Delhi,","May 7, 2018"
"My first trip to Delhi and I felt at welcomed and at home here. From the moment I entered the secure hotel I was most welcomed and cared for. Checkin in was easy. F&B staff were so friendly. They even got me to try different Indian foods. All were quite delicious. My stay was unexpectedly extended and I didn’t feel well over the weekend. The hotel staff were very concerned although I was okay. The manager on duty came to my room with staff and found medicines for me and sent up a lovely and light meal. They continued to check on me throughout the entire rest of my week stay! Ive never had such attention.My housekeeper, Sunil cared for my room and even made me some animals. He was very responsive and so respectful. Asking me each day for time I would like service. Everything he did was with a genuine smile. He made me feel at home and attended to.I wish I could remember everyone to list such 5 star service. So Thank You to all the lovely staff at Crowne Plaza for a most pleasant stay!","May 3, 2018"
"Excellent food prepared under chef Deepak. He is world’s best chef. Courtesy of Narendra and Punit heart touching. Rooms are spacious and very well maintained. Bed and pillows very comfortable. I stayed for 15 days and every day I liked the food, never got bored. Keep up.","May 3, 2018"

In Bar Mr Kamalesh & Mr Ashish understands need of the movement.","April 29, 2018"
"Definitely a decent business hotel with all the usual whistles and bells, reasonable internet, good room service selection etc. The staff are courteous however its obvious this hotel runs on a 'script' basis which can be a little tiring. Although a comfortable stay I did find the constant interruptions at breakfast and at evening meals to be a little annoying, there are only so many times you can be asked 'how is your meal' and 'are you sure you wouldn't like any egg preparations'. If I were to give some advice, we all like attentive service but when it becomes intrusive it makes people feel self conscious, I just wanted to enjoy my book.Special thanks to Shama the Duty Manager who went the extra mile and finally got a response from my companies travel provider to provide bill back info which had been outstanding.","April 27, 2018"
"Recently stayed in this hotel as part of an India tour. The service from all staff was impeccable. The chefs were incredible suggesting foods to suit our palate and offering to cook something from scratch if we required. The room was very comfortable with a view across the city. Its not in a central location but taxis were always available at the door and reasonably priced. It is not easy to walk anywhere from this hotel so a taxi is the best mode of transport. Beware of the Tuctucs, a price agreed on entering is not necessarily what is paid when you alight!!","April 25, 2018"
"We stayed at the Crowne Plaza New Delhi Mayur Vihar for one night before leaving for the UK.We found the staff to be very pleasant and helpful, the food excellent and our room immaculate. Will definitely opt for it again.","April 24, 2018"
"Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar, will make you feel at home! Be it hospitality, courtesy, food and best in all is the people around you. The rooms are awesome, well neat, clean, high quality built and an awesome buffet. Staff members like Narendar, Devendra, Nikhil, Ratan, Avinash, Nikhil, Shama.... there is a new guy who is very strong at rapport building - a young chap who has recently joined. The whole staff is awesome! I had a booking at Savoy Suites and just because of the hospitality I cancelled the booking at Savoy Suites and changed it to Crowne Plaza.","April 23, 2018"

"We went to this hotel to attend an product launch of OLX. The food served here was super duper SAD and waste.This was literally prepared for the sake of preparing. Otherwise this hotel claims to be 5 star but looking at the quality, they should look for a better cook and then serve food. Rest all amenities are good but if you don’t have a solid cook then you should convert your hotel into a luxury service apartments.","April 12, 2018"
Writing this review after staying for couple of weeks. Consistent quality of service. What differentiates this hotel from others is it’s people - from front desk to house keeping to restaurant. They go the extra mile to make you feel special and feel “at home”. Energetic team at restaurant - chef Deepak was phenomenal with his dishes and gives variety every single day! Others to mention in restaurant are Nithin and Akshay and takes special care of the guests. Will visit again!,"April 11, 2018"

"What a find! The Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar was an excellent hotel to enjoy our first couple of days and subsequent last day of our golden triangle tour in Delhi relaxing - excellent pool area, well appointed Executive rooms, gym, restaurants and bar. Food was excellent, each member of staff without exception was extremely pleasant and helpful; from connecting our devices to the wifi, phoning our tour company on a couple of occasions, and ensuring we sampled various delicious Indian dishes in the restaurant - everyone went out of their way to ensure our stay was perfect. Drinks were a bit pricey - all the government taxes don't help but to be expected in a city hotel. We looked forward to returning to this hotel at the end of our tour - it was definitely our favourite - like coming home. Amazing staff, good location, would definitely recommend.","April 9, 2018"
Unfortunately once I had some query from Hotel so they just take the call and after listening me they disconnect call 5 times and when I asked to talk with duty manager the operator girl said duty manager is busy now call after some time when I call again she said the same thing .Some points that I realized about this hotel * duty manager enough busy they don't have Time for guest *hotel staff don't know that what is the hospitality *how to talk Someone specially Mr vhaibav * even they abuse in lobby front of guest *,"April 8, 2018"
"Our tour group stayed on here two occasions in March (at the beginning and end of our 2 week tour). The hotel lives up to it's Crowne Plaza reputation. The lobby is beautiful, the restaurant is airy and spacious and the hotel rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The front desk staff were very welcoming and helped us arrange a local taxi on our first day to tour around Delhi. The restaurant staff, although not super attentive, were polite and friendly, and gave us free dessert when we ordered off the menu for lunch and dinner! The housekeeping staff and bell boys were also very helpful and polite. The location is also very convenient, close to several attractions. I only wish we had time to use the outdoor pool, which we had a glimpse of from one of the rooms! I would definitely recommend this hotel!","April 7, 2018"
"This hotel makes me feel like home, so much of comfort and amazing services by the staff.. Few people I need to thank some people who made my stay to an extreme memorable level ..

We have visisted the Crowne Plaza End of March and we were amazed with the response time of Hous Keeping for any of our needs. It was early morning where we needed to rush forbour work however the services were amazing. From the room to the bed comfort and product offered. The only feedback I had that I felt my checkin being dull rest all was superb making me again coming back on this Sunday.,"April 5, 2018"

"A pleasant start to a ten day tour - attentive staff and good quality rooms. There is an issue with the taxi service linked to the hotel which charges way beyond reasonable rates. This does affect the quality of service and the reputation of the hotel, my advice would be to request a regular taxi to avoid ten times the rates and constant requests to take you on a tour of Delhi.","March 18, 2018"
"This Crowne Plaza property is located very close to the New Ashok Nagar Metro Station ( you have to cross a small bridge though, so a bit of a walk ) . So that ways quite convenient if you wish to travel by metro. Good, nice and big rooms with all the requisite essentials. Service quality, however, needs a bit of improvement. ","March 15, 2018"
"I have been staying in Delhi for quite frequently and stayed in multiple 5 star hotel. But location wise and hospitality that I get in this Hotel,I always prefer to stay in this Hotel. The location is superb and very convenient to reach any part of NCR very easily. The rooms are cozy and excellent. But the main reason I prefer is the Hospitality I get here every time. The people are so friendly that they don't let feel you are not at your home.. Everyday when I entered in Dining room the warm welcome for all the stuff's made me feel so relaxed. As I stayed for long time and usual dishes become quite common after some time, the Chefs and Managers never wanted me to have the regular buffet menu. They made different dishes everyday. Tarun and Asish to name a few who made me excellent and flavorful dishes according to my test. Tarun was very caring about my choice of food so that I don't become fatty or sick. His continental dishes served with charming smile and Asish's fresh croissant I am really going to miss. Deepak, a very nice and cool person and a person who always made time for me and all guests even when the whole lobby was tightly packed. And Hosiyar and Udit i remember to name a few whom I find very helpful while they wait on the table. And in room service Ali was great during my very long stay. He made my room so neat and clean i feel relaxed when i came back to room exhausted.Mr Punit and Mr Narendra , I must say, are fantastic managers. They love their job and loves the guests and take care of very very small things. They have very keen eye how people are handled by the stuff's. They are exceptional in remembering Guest's preferences. And this is what will make anyone feel very proud to be in this hotel.To make a single sentence about the Hotel, I want to say, excellent Hotel with Excellent people around all the time.","March 11, 2018"
Went for Sunday Brunch to this hotel. Good selection of food and an elaborate Dessert Buffet. The staff is very polite and food is very nice. Would have preferred more International fare than the Indian dishes but saying that it might be for the local crowd. Also felt the salt in starters was more than required. Only disappointing factor was the soup. The chicken sweet corn soup was without any flavour.,"March 4, 2018"
"Its really enjoyable and comfortable to stay in Crowne Plaza, New Delhi. near to New Delhi Railway Station and also to IGI Airport. Nice food and nice accommodation. I will stay again in this Hotel for my next visit to Delhi.","March 1, 2018"
"We stayed for 2 nights as part of a tour. The rooms were good, bathroom was very good, cleanliness was fine.Buffet dinner and breakfasts were very good, with a great range on offer. The dining room catered for a lot of people without feeling like a canteen.Service was good - Reception was efficient and helpful, and catering staff were excellent.The only criticism I can make is the lack of outside space to lounge in; just a pool with loungers, no garden. But you don’t come to Delhi as a tourist in order to spend a lot of time lounging in a garden.Would happily go here again.","March 1, 2018"
"We had stayed here and found the stay very comfortable, nice big rooms with good views, we took the one facing the poolside on 6th floor, room service is quick, the Executive chef gave us the yummy food, full marks to him, we will recommend this hotel to our friends because of stay and sumptuous food from Executive chef, Also The breakfast buffet is unique.we will definitely go again for sure.","February 28, 2018"

"We've stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. It was a business trip, so we did not expect that much , we have points for Crown Plazas. But this was the best Crown Plaza we've ever stayed. What made the difference? Service ! What amazed me is : We had dinner in their restaurant and my husband wanted a tiramisu. He did not like it , left it. The waiter asked why , he told it's not a good one. Soon after the manager came with the young pastry chef to ask what was wrong. They did not charge us for the tiramisu and apologized. Then soon after we had a telephone call when in the room from the manager asking if they can come with the main pastry chef ,because they made a brand new triramisu for my husband . They wanted him to try it. We could not believe it. They came ; with the tiramisu in their hands, we tried it; it was excellent. They told us they changed the recipe in the restaurant a little bit to go with different taste buds . We were really impressed. Thanks to Narendra; the restaurant manager and the chefs! Bravo! The hotel is very close to Askhardam Temple, it is a must. Even if you don not have so much time at least you can do this temple because it is too close. But if you have time these are not to be missed: Humayun's Tomb, Jama Mascid and Sikh Temple.","February 12, 2018"
"I have stayed at this hotel multiple times, and have really seen the service level and quality deteriorate. Check in was very lame, the room wasn’t ready even when I checked in very late. Breakfast quality was average, long service times. And then check out experience was worse. Asked the person to email invoice which they didn’t and even after emailing the hotel several times, they still haven’t and don’t even bother to respond. What a way to keep IHG and Crowne plaza reputation.","February 11, 2018"
"The hotel is located in the suburbs of New Delhi on the ring road middle of no where. Before booking I googled the location and found the it was located adjacent to some Mall but found was a place with only liquor shops. There are 2 Metro stations 6 mins walk from the hotel but the area is too much stinky due some open sewage nearby. Rooms are good and beds extremely comfortable. I stayed at hotel for 5 nights with my wife. Staff was friendly but seemed not be experienced. When we checked-in copies of our passports were obtained. The staff was having problem locating our visas therefore I assisted them finding the page with our visa. A copy was obtained for the visa and the passports. I was asked if we had any other document from the Immigaration, I told that no such doc was provided to us. At about 10:30 pm while we were asleep as of a tiring long travel received a call from the hotel front desk asking for the copy of our visa again as was required to be submitted to the immigration office. One of the receptionist came to our room to collect our passports. I had a copy of the passports so I provided the copy of the visa.Next morning at 7:45 am we were again waken-up by the reception asking for the same info for the 3rd time.  ","February 8, 2018"
"My stay was good. I am extremely thankful to Bhupendra who works on 5th floor and took cleanliness of room no 501 very seriously. Other staff of this hotel like for mini bar, food and beverages service, evening lounge etc were generous and helpful too. I specially liked the crew for breakfast who always knew what i wanted and were ready to serve as needed. I ate Kadai on recommendation from the chefs and it was really yummy and delicious. I actually order one more post that.I had issues during checkout and i had to wait for sometime during checkout as the printers were not working.In all , i definitely enjoyed my stay at this property, would love to come back again and recommend to others too.","February 6, 2018"
"Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar is an absolute stunner property. I was staying here for a personal visit and totally enjoyed my time here. Right from entering the hotel, which starts with grand lobby and a great bar. The check in is very smooth. The rooms were the most sought after rooms with just everything perfectly in order. Comfortable bed, lovely city views, and a room at higher floor were just for the brownie points. The washroom with a lovely tub was so mesmerising. i also got a chance to use their salon services and laundry services and they were impeccable.I am definitely returning back to the property.","February 3, 2018"
"The hotel is a calm oasis in the middle of crowded noisy Delhi. The service was very friendly and attentive and the room large and very clean. The washroom is large with a great shower and required amenities. The bed was very comfortable. Television service extensive and high quality. Lots of complimentary bottled water each day. The hotel restaurant was reasonably priced and the service truly outstanding. Three waiters stood out particularly (Nitin, Gokul and Punit, the manager of the waiters). The Indian food was outstanding and the chef took great care to make items to order. The wait staff would also make juice combinations to order. The breakfast buffet is extensive with lots of choice. The dinner buffet seems pricey but once you factor in other a la carts costs, worth it for the variety and tastes. The small milk cake for dessert is worth the bite! The hotel's location is far from Old Delhi by car but very close by the metro which is fast, cheap (20 rupees) and dependable. One word of advice: take the rickshaw from the hotel to the metro station. Although very close by, walking the distance was taking your life into your own hands. Very dangerous due to no sidewalks and complete road chaos. At 10 rupees it is worth the small price! ","February 2, 2018"
The rooms were lovely with hairdryers toiletries and fridge. Beds were huge and extremely comfortable. We ate in the restaurant each night and were very pleased with the food. The staff noted personal preferences and the chef carried them out. You were made to feel that your wishes were important to them. I do not know the price of this hotel as it was booked for us by Trinetra travel as part of a package they put together for us. Unable to click on ratings not responding but everything was great.,"January 31, 2018"
"The initial impression of the hotel was of comfort, high standards, and staff with a desire to please. The bedroom, just “standard” was large with a lovely big bathroom and shower. Nothing was too much trouble, the staff went out of their way to be helpful and to ensure satisfaction. We were part of a very small Saga group and we were all delighted to have such a positive start to our tour.","January 23, 2018"

Truly remarkable and ably supported by Chef Raja ( he made Pongal for me on Sankranthi - I was so touched ) and Mayaram!2) Ajith, Ankit, Abhilash, Devendra at the Concierge ! Very first centric they were.3) Anil from Housekeeping was outstanding. He made my room with such dedication and commitment. His towel art has found a place in my heart ! HK Supervisor Gaurav was equally impressive .4) Gokul, Udit, Nitin represent the fresh face of Infinity F&B team. I was meeting them for the first time and they are remarkable- very cheerful, energetic and friendly! 5) Sujit from Room Service and Bhuvan Bhust from Laundy displayed the consistency and precision of a Swiss watch !6) Ratan’s smoothies were awesome every morning for b/fast. Narender came across like a champion of guest centricity .Thank you for everything! ","January 21, 2018"
"Booked in to Radisson Blu Noida MBD for three nights, stayed for 1 and left. I then moved to Crown Plaza 4.7 km away and for less than half the price!! Got a bigger, more modern room, with separate bath and shower ( as opposed to Shower head in the bath) better view. Electric remote operated curtains. A glass TV viewing screen from the bath so one could watch TV from the bath again with remote control blinds.The Crown Plaza included dinner and breakfast not just breakfast. And a decent restaurant with wide range of choices. Crown Plaza was just a far better option and made Raddison feel like a complete rip off. Must just clarify was attending a conference at the Crown Plaza and company had block bookings so that may have influenced price at Crown Plaza. But even if the two were exactly the same price, I would still recommend Crown Plaza over Raddison Blu MBD. Raddison did have a very quaint little bar on the first floor. So stop in there for a drink, see the foyer and stay somewhere else!","January 21, 2018"
The rooms are gorgeous as well as practical!! The bed is one of most comfortable beds I have slept in. The staff is very polite and exceptionally attentive. The breakfast spread is good. However what sets its apart from any place is again the attentive staff. Special mention to Akshay who made our breakfast experience great. Also it was really thoughtful of the house keeping staff to make some amazing towel art. My child was very excited to see it. The view from my room was amazing.The bathroom supplies were exceptionally good. I would really like to thank the staff for making our stay so pleasant,"January 18, 2018"
"From the security people at the front door, the front desk employees, the restaurant staff, and the housekeeping folks, everyone was polite, friendly and accomodating.A few call-outs - Suresh from housekeeping who kept my room in great shape all week.

"We stayed at the Crowne plaza Mayur Vihar Noida for a total of 3 nights. The hotel looks good from the outside and is excellent on the inside. Very nicely styled, decorated and appointed from the lobby to the dining and the rooms. The check in is very efficient although it wasn't busy on our arrivals. The service from ALL the staff was excellent, especially in the dining room. The food is excellent with great variety for breakfast and dinner. The room and ensuite are spacious with plenty of storage and usual requirements such as a safe, fridge with snacks & drinks etc. The bed is comfortable and very quiet. We left excess luggage here while we traveled throughout India at no cost and it was safe. The business centre is well equiped and so is the gym. The outdoor pool is nice but we didn't use it.Great free internet and safe and secure. Great value.We enjoyed our stay at the Crowne. Why not a 5 star rating, the location is good for taxi or car to places near by but you can not walk outside of the hotel as it is not close to anything and it's not safe.","January 9, 2018"
Impressive business hotel with modern rooms and big window to the batroom that can be covered with a curtain. This gives a lot of visual space however. There’s also a somewhat separated office corner. Restaurant and bar are nice. Staff is extremely helpfull as often in India. The whole hotel is also well secured. Excellent when doing business in Noida. ,"January 8, 2018"
"Stayed here for a couple of nights whilst visiting colleagues in Noida. The hotel is comfortable and I’ll come back here next visit for sure. To pick out a lovely example. The bed sheets are super soft and worth taking your pyjamas off to enjoy! I was in a super king size bed in a king sized room, spacious and well equipped. The restaurant has a multi-national menu which appears popular with local middle class families. I’d recommend the Indian food there. The very attentive waiters told me the food was western oriented for the visiting guests. The restaurant does an a l carte or buffet menu. The a la carte reused many of the buffet elements. Nonetheless the food and service is good. The openness of staff and fully open kitchen gives confidence. Looking forward to my next visit","January 8, 2018"

"The hotel is located in an ideal position as it is near the highway and therefore easy to get on to the express route which takes you to Agra and also not very far from Akshardham. The main restaurant in the hotel has an international cuisine with staff who are extremely helpful and attentive.

"Firstly at check in, I was recognized as a platinum club member which is always wonderful. We got upgraded to executive rooms for all the three rooms we had. Check-in didn’t take long and were informed of all amenities they had. Upon entering our rooms, we were very happy with everything, we were put on floor 12. The property’s condition was top notch, and everything was clean and neat everywhere but the best thing that we encountered was their amazing service. Service from the front desk staff to housekeeping and everyone at the restaurant and in room dining was spectacular. I commend the hospitality we received at this hotel. No negative comments. Loved our stay here. ","December 24, 2017"
"Recent spent 3 nights at this hotel, whilst it’s situated on the outskirts of dehli, the hotel is merely a 5 minute walk away from the metro station. The new mall of India is only 3 stops away by metro. The service at the hotel is exceptional with staff members greeting me by name and providing personalized service in the form of remembering my individual breakfast preferences. Rooms are spacious and comes with every amenity one would associate with a 5* hotel. Please note that the hotel is situated right next to the metro line thus during the day you will hear some noise of the trains passing by, however this noise is not entirely disturbing. Will definitely return in future ","December 21, 2017"

Excellent Food with good service . The state of art was just perfect. Elaborate Buffet and detailed layout of food was eye catching and mouth watering . This indeed is a place to visit and very less place in Delhi is like this restaurant,"December 13, 2017"
I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights with a colleague. The service was exceptional - they managed to achieve the right balance of attentive without being overbearing. They even remembered our names each time they saw us and were so friendly. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in and the food was great too (breakfast especially good). I cannot praise this hotel and their staff enough and I cant wait to go back in February.,"December 7, 2017"
"We felt really spoilt. The staff are incredible and went the extra mile to make us welcome.We arrived very early in the morning and the staff made a great effort to prepare our room earlier than the checkin time.The room was spacious, clean with crisp white bed linen and fluffy white towels.There was a large bed and a lovely area to chill in. Ok the view is not great and the hotel is not near anything, but we had a long flight so we just lounged around by the very tempting but cold swimming pool.The bath products were luxurious, with a bath and a separate shower.The chef, Deepak made us a very tasty lunch and later a lovely chocolate cake arrived to celebrate our Anniversary.The menu is varied but expensive but luckily breakfast and dinner was included in our package. The evening buffet was delicious with far too many dishes to tackle. Thanks also to Punit, Ashish, Nitin, Vaibhav. Apologies to names I don’t remember.The spa looked lovely but again very expensive even by London standards.The spa staff were not at all busy. Just bringing the price down would encourage more people to visit.We were hugely surprised by the staff, from the reception to the dining area and the people who looked after our room, would like to thank them for making our stay enjoyable. We will definitely return and recommend friends and family to stay here.","December 6, 2017"

"My April 2017 trip was excellent. The Nov trip wasn't that great. Arrived at midnight, tired and hungry but was given a wrong room (booked a King size but given a room with a twin bed). Had to go down and ask them to rectify. The mattress was too soft and I ended up having a backache. Towels and bathrobe are greying and ageing. Metal holder for the shower head broken and not replaced. Sign of old age is clearly setting in and the hotel is not doing anything to maintain its standards. Mercifully, the staff are excellent with their service although the concierge gave me wrong information on which Metro station to go and there was a FOH boy who behaved a like a robot (no greetings/smiles and clueless on how to deal with guests but luckily his superior stepped in sorted the matter quickly).","November 30, 2017"
The hotel is good. The best part is the hospitality which is awesome.I would recommend to visit the restaurant “Infinity”. The evening manager Puneet is impressive. The chef comes to the guests asking about there preferences and they cook it for you. The room service is excellent. The morning guy Bobby provides prompt service.,"November 29, 2017"

"I had a chance to stay at this hotel recently during a business visit to Noida.My experience was as below :The room was good, though the bed was extra soft which made it uncomfortable. Food was good.Wifi didnt work which was a big disappointment for me given that i needed that on a business travel in the middle of the week. The IT folks had absolutely no idea on how to fix that. Service was very average. After my dinner, they called me to check if they can pick up the food tray to which i said yes. I waited for couple of hours, no one turned up.While checking in i has asked for a smoking room. Later when i asked for a match, i was informed that its a non-smoking room. The confusion lasted for 20 mins and eventually sorted out.Next day, during breakfast the experience was unpleasant. Its irritating when the boys constantly come and ask if they can clear the plate even when they can see that the food is unfinished and the guest is still eating from it. To me, its basic etiquette which is missing... Overall a poor experience from a hotel which is supposed to a 4 star property and has a decent traiff attached to it.","November 25, 2017"
"My wife and I stayed at this Crowne Plaza during the Delhi portion of our India vacation. The hotel was excellent. I definitely appreciated that they recognized and rewarded my status with the IHG chain. The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. All of the meals we took in the hotel were very good (breakfast buffet, dinner in the restaurant, and room service). We especially want to acknowledge Mr. Nareendra Singh who greeted us for breakfast each day with a warm welcome and suggested some great Indian breakfast items for us to try. Thanks for your awesome hospitality.","November 10, 2017"

"Though the hotel on the whole needs urgent makeover, with tiles peeling off, plug point on the verge of falling off, carpets giving way, the biggest asset of the hotel is its staff. Starting from the gatekeeper to the room service staff g out of their way to make your stay comfortable. Spacious room and good amenities as expected is another plus point. The exotic and lavish spread for buffet breakfast,lunch and dinner is what I love about Infinity. The only other let down is the Elle Spa and Saloon. Seriously dont waste your money there.","November 5, 2017"
Very good rooms and very good service and super buffet for breakfast and lunch and dinner. Reception and lobby does not quite match the rest of the hotel. Conveniently located if your work and meetings are in Noida side. But a bit far removed from South Delhi and takes ages to get there during the day.,"November 3, 2017"
"I stayed at this location for five days. Everything was great. Service was great. Until the last day checking out at the front desk. I specifically asked that I be charged in INR instead of my local currency (TWD). My credit card company usually offers me excellent conversion rates. When I was handed the receipt to sign, I also checked the box to have the transaction be done in INR. However, front desk insisted in charging my local currency. I was and am still very unhappy when I was handed the final credit card receipt showing that the hotel has charged me my local currency made at a conversion rate +3.75%. The irony that they stated on the receipt that a choice of payment currencies was offered including INR, when in reality they insisted on using their conversion service. Gave me the impression that the hotel really want to make money off this conversion service and any unsuspecting visitors.","November 1, 2017"

Check in : I requested late check in . send email to Hotel never received a reply back .. it was a confirmed reservation on miles /reward night . 2. On check in I was told I am a free guest for Hotel , then I have to explain him that I spend and pay for 10 nights then I get this reward night so IT IS NOT FREE NIGHT . 3. I ASKED FOR complimentary breakfast which was not responded well .. I was told to take some discounted breakfast package…however they did not tell me if I don’t take it now in morning, I will be slave of hotel and have to pay double charges for the same.4. Room service : I ordered room service food , which was told a 20 min service , it was delivered at 10 pm after 45 min by that time in was in my sleep .. 5. In the room there are bugs on floor . you can see them walking in night after 2 AM . 6. I asked for a bath room robe which was delivered in morning . 7. In morning , I went for the breakfast, this place needs renovation , floor and sealing required repair. 8. In Breakfast I take only fruits- only three variety – pineapple , papaya and water melon were available .. that too of worst quality available in market.. all tasteless… no other regional or sessional fruit were available .. this was a jok.. 9. I asked for cold coffee, I was told it will be charged extra as it is not part of the menu .only hot coffee is free and available . then I asked bring milk from conflux table , and ask for ice and then took few coffee pouches and shaken them in two glasses.. and made the cold coffee there itself with all the ingredients available there for free. This is kind of service Manger gave in Break fast..10. In break fast they did not treat me like a Platinum member .. no reorganization which all Hotel do …11. Yes there was a follow up for the bill to be signed .. I singed one time theey bring one more time .. I have to tell them do I have to sign several times.. then they realize the mistake . Check out : When I checked out they try to robe me with all sort of ways .. first they put some charges for the room .. I told them it is points night s/ reward night they they removed it . Then they try to put the maximin possible for the break fast .. and told me that I did not take the offer innight ,,now I have to pay what ever they say .. and I asked for Duty manager .. he came and behave as if he has no power..his name wa Raman …he needs to go out from this hotel to save this hotel from failing .. looks hotel is already failing … Finally I spend 30 min without any success and paid their bill and came out.. told them never in my life I am going to come back …And shared the experience with duty manager his name was Raman…he was more into robbing the customer than customer service.. I go to IHG Hotels all around however this was one of the worst..I will not recommend this Hotel to any one . one night prior to this we were in a group booking in Crown plaza in Kathmandu .. ever they have better food and facilities . This hotel is shame in the Name of IHG group and as an India I felt ashamed of this Hotel .. All these Hotel kill tourisum in India . Any questions /clarifications you can call me or send email .

"There are four Crowne Plazas in Delhi, and this one is situated at Mayur Vihar Noida, a little out of the way with nothing of interest to see locally although 20 minutes in a taxi gets you into the centre of town. Security is very good; a steel roller gate manned 24 hours and an airport-type bag scanner at the pedestrian entrance. Staff are exceptionally well trained, polite and efficient. The rooms are comparable with other western hotels, clean and well maintained but small in comparison to the forts further west in Rajasthan. This is a great hotel to break you in to India if it's your first visit.The restaurant is fabulous with a wide selection of Indian and Western cuisine, again the staff are well trained and attentive. There is an elevated railway very nearby and a dual carriageway but the sound insulation in the rooms is such that you are unaware of them. It has an indoor gym and outdoor swimming pool that is netted off to prevent the ubiquitous pigeon ingress. Recommended.","October 16, 2017"
"I stayed with my family for 4 nights in the month of Sep 2017. It was the first time i had brought my family to Delhi and It was one of the best vacation we had in the recent past. We were given a very cozy room facing the Akshardham and the Pool. We were pampered with mouth watering delicacies by the wonderful chefs in the restaurant. My son was so impressed with chef Deepak that he mentioned about him in his vacation narrative essay in school. All the staffs, right from the front desk to the staffs in the restaurant and the security guards are so polite and humble in their approach. They took very good care of us during our stay and always made us feel at home. Now my wife knows why i prefer to stay in this hotel for all my business trips to Delhi/Noida. Kudos to all the staffs of this hotel. You have set a very high benchmark for hospitality for your fellow competitors to even dream of.","October 16, 2017"
"1st time staying at the Crowne Plaza Mayur:1. After the hotel was booked by our HK Travel agent, I emailed the hotel for car pick up from airport and it was done and confirmed very easily2. Car pick up from Airport was great, driver was very friendly, offered a cold bottle of water and asked if the AC was cold enough, was a long 1 hour + drive due to traffic was building up around 5.30 pm3. Security was good, car got checked before entering hotel premise, bags got scanned and you get scanned with metal detector as well4. Lobby was nice and straight forward, check in was very easy and when i told them of my IHG membership they placed an IHG flag infront of me lol5. Room was nice and spacious, view of the river and the trains going by, the auto curtains with the remote was fun to play with6. room had ashtray but no matches, had to call housekeeping for matches to be delivered which is very strange as hotels in other countries the matches would have been with the ashtray, why waste house keeping man power to physically bring matches to a room, I got two boxes of matches but one was empty WTF 7. Ordered room service and the food was brought up with the drinks and Ice I had requested, food was very nice, I ordered the Combo of the day (curry). after I ate the food an hour later I recd a call asking me how the food was and if I wanted someone to take the delivery table away. nice service.8. Breakfast was very nice, the service is amazing, its buffet style but you can literally just sit at the table and they will ask you what you want to eat and bring it all to you, even when walking into the restaurant and I told them my room number the manager immediately welcomed me by name, most hotels Ive been to dont even do this. great personal touchI usually stay at another 5 Star Hotel beginning with R but the pricing was crazy, almost double the cost of this hotel, I will be staying at this hotel from now on as its just as good or if this hotel is FULL, literally next door is The Holiday Inn from the same IHG group :)Issues: I didn't like PILLOWs in the room, there was 4 on the bed but I could stack 3 off them on top of each other and they could get squashed to the size of 1, that is how soft it was. I would recommend hotel to provide 2 soft and 2 medium/hard like other hotels do so that guest can choose, the mattress was a bit soft as well but It didnt bother me as much as the pillows.Room service, I ordered over 3 days the same meal with same order of drinks with ICE, only the 1st day did I get ICE, the 2nd and 3rd day NO ICE, such a simple order couldn't be done right.","October 10, 2017"
"My friend and I stayed here recently and we have nothing but great things to say about this place. The hotel itself is very massive and kept up pretty good. The rooms are huge, well furnished and most importantly, clean. The beds were like sleeping on clouds as were the pillows. The restaurant serves up delicious food at a reasonable price. Most importantly, the staff. They were out of this world. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay very enjoyable. These guys are out of this world!!!","October 7, 2017"
"We stayed here for two nights while in Delhi. It was my birthday weekend and the staff added some extra touches to our room. My husband arranged for flowers and a cake, which were both excellent. Some staff kept thinking it was our honeymoon, which it wasn't, and so we came back to flowers in the bathtub and on the towels! The breakfast was delicious and we ordered room service for dinner one night, which was also fabulous. The room and bathroom were very clean and we slept great. Quiet rooms and no problems with outside noise.  The hallway and outside of the hotel do smell strange, but I guess that's New Delhi for you. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy and taken care of. There's a bar off the entrance and then a large dining room on the other side of the lobby. I did feel sick after eating some nuts and chips given to me at the bar, which was a shame, but never after the breakfast or dinner. I highly recommend staying here, even though it's out of the city center. We used a taxi to go to the Taj Mahal, through the hotel. It was about $200 for the two of us, but worth it, plus set up with a guide- left before 6 am and it took under 3 hours both ways (we slept the whole ride). All in all, we were very pleased and felt well taken care of. We were sad to leave! Oh, and there's a ""mall"" across the road where you can buy wine and beer. The walk is interesting with the cows roaming around!","September 29, 2017"
"This hotel was one of the best hotels in the world for customer service. The duty manager that I had frequent conversations with, was very professional, a good listener and personable. She was the best there is. I had an issue with my TV programming and the staff member they sent to my room could not fix the problem and his English was not good enough to communicate with me about the issues I was having. The manager, listened to my explanation of the issue and she came to the room and together we both were shown how to fix the problem. She admitted to me that prior to this episode, she was not sufficiently trained in the programming and operation of the TV and remote. She helped bridge the language barrier with the staff member and became schooled, with me, to the proper use of the remote. Being a good manager sometimes requires that you be able to do the job yourself, not just delegate that a staff member do it.The hotel had lost my proper registration, due to the travel agency I used. I had pre-paid for 5 days and was shocked when I arrived to check in and was told that they did not have a reservation for me. After several minutes of shock, I was able to find my original receipt and paperwork from the travel agency- one that I had used for 6 years with no problems at all. With the receipt, that were able to find my reservation and pre-payment. She walked me to my room and was going to give me my choice of room and view, probably to make up for the original mistake. I chose the 1st one that she showed me, mainly because I was on crutches and need a room as close to the elevator as possible. The room was large, well furnished and had typical furnishings like any 5 star rated hotel My temporary disability made the separate walk-in shower a plus, since I would never be able to get in and out of the huge bathtub. I chose a view of the freeway...she called it a view of the pool. I guess if you put your nose of the glass and looked straight down you could see the pool. It was a stretch calling it a ""pool view"", but it sounds better than a ""freeway view"". I was fascinated with the remote that controlled the curtains. This option is rarely available and make adjusting the large curtains a breeze!!The restaurant was excellent and the breakfast buffet was as good as any buffet in Las Vegas, which is my hometown. I am an expert and seasoned traveler and worked in the industry long enough to appreciate a good buffet. Breakfast was served 6:30-10:30 AM. This extended time frame allowed one to sleep late and still eat breakfast. There was a good selection of Indian dishes, along with freshly made pastries and fresh fruit and an omelet bar to make every palate happy. The servers helped me with my plate since I needed one hand to manage my crutches.My only issue with the restaurant was an issue that caused me to avoid the hotel for dinner because of the issue. The dinner buffet was about $34.00 after taxes, which I felt was a lot of money, even in Las Vegas, but in New Delhi, this was the high end of the market. When I sat down ( with my crutches) I was asked what I wanted to drink. I asked for ice tea, a pretty common request from an American. The server brought me a glass of tea, in a 12 oz glass, not cold and no ice. I asked for some ice and lemon. He eventually brought me a sweetened cold tea, with ice and a fancy glass and straw to drink it with. It looked like something a bartender would make. I only drank a little, since it had been sweetened ( I am diabetic) What pissed me off was that there was a $2.95 charge for the ice tea!!! I was so shocked but I rarely argue about issues like this because I don't want to make a scene in the restaurant and I know that the hotel will remove the charge but it just is not something worth making a scene over. I always wait until I review the company on Trip Advisor. This is one of the issues that kept me from giving the hotel a 5 * rating. Being overcharged for something that my experience feels is including in the initial price. The initial price for the buffet was high enough.... charging for iced tea is pushing the envelope. The other overcharging issue was the practice of having a ""spa"" instead of having the Jacuzzi outside, next to the swimming pool. This is a normal practice of all hotels, regardless of price rage. If there is a swimming pool, there is always a Jacuzzi next to it. They moved the Jacuzzi into the spa and charged for using it. The spa also had a sauna, massage and steam bath, which is normal. The rationalization of charging guests for using a Jacuzzi is not a good business move...the proof is that I was one of the few people that used the pool or spa during the time that I was there. The duty manager offer a discount certificate to me, but I didn't feel that I should be charges for using a hot tub. Most hotels use the hot tub to attract guests to the pool area, since rarely does one ""swim"" in the pool. Guests like to sunbathe and visit with others, along with lots of alcohol. Alcohol sales tied to a pool and hot tub are big business in Las Vegas and at the previous hotel in Mumbai, where I had spent the week before. So I know that it is an accepted practice in India, also.I was very happy with the service, room and food at the hotel It's funny how little things will prevent future business. I have every intention of returning to New Delhi and see the sights that my inability to walk without crutches prevented me from seeing. I am undecided if I will stay here next time......I am making this review after staying at a similar hotel in Mumbai the previous week. They had a rooftop pool and hot tub and the ice tea was included as was any non-alcoholic drink.","September 26, 2017"

"While I love mostly love this hotel, I would suggest a lesson in customer service. I had an issue over a $38 charge for access to the concierge lounge (which I had for free my previous four visits). Though I did not know, they now charge, even a Spire Elite member, to access the concierge lounge (The ONLY hotel I have EVER heard of that does this). I was told this while standing at the front desk with a business associate, waiting to access that lounge for a quiet meeting. Very embarrassing to me being told that I cannot access. Bottom line, I called the General Manager of the hotel who, instead of immediately just confirming, ""give him access"", began asking the on duty manager question after question, that I could hear. ""How many nights, how much was his room..."". I finally said forget it and sat in the bar area. I like this hotel and location. My previous review was five start. I just feel salty about this past experience. As a Spire Elite, I expect more from MY hotel. The highlights, Devandra - HE is a great asset to this property. Always so helpful and knowledgeable. Sharma at the front desk. Passang in the spa was wonderful.","September 21, 2017"
"Upon arrival, even though it was 2am, the reception team welcomed us with a smile and gave us an upgraded room because we were celebrating our honeymoon. The room was wonderful, in one of the highest floors, so we had a nice view from the window and it was very spacious. They had provided us with special decorations in our room: swan-shaped towels, rose petals and a cake were all waiting for us!The breakfast was magnificent, with plenty of different options both Indian and Western. They had several live cooking stations: waffles, smoothies, omelettes,... It was also the only hotel in all India we have been to that offered bottled water for breakfast.As for the room service, we have to say that the service was quick and the food delicious (we had Chinese noodles and pasta if I recall correctly).The swimming pool was in the rooftop, and was delightful as you could swim while seeing Delhi's skyline.The only negative point I see from this hotel is that it was really far away from the city centre, more than half an hour drive. So, for instance, when returning to the hotel in the evening none of the tuc-tucs would like to ride us that far so we had to take a taxi instead...","September 20, 2017"

I was very impressed and would definitely go again.,"September 19, 2017"

"I travel to Delhi almost every month for work and ever since I discovered this hotel, I have been a regular here. Highly courteous front-office staff, very comfortable rooms and the amazing food at the restaurant have left a very positive impression from the day one. I would like to thank the restaurant staff for their excellent hospitality and the chefs for the wonderful spread. Special thanks to Chef Deepak Nanda for all the sumptuous treats every time I drop in to the restaurant. He always goes out of the way for making one's gastronomical experience extraordinary. I would also like to mention about restaurant staff Puneet and Digambar for their great customer service. I would highly recommend the hotel for anyone traveling to Delhi either for business or leisure and don't ever miss the restaurant!!!","September 16, 2017"
"I have traveled quite extensively globally and stayed in many hotels and the hospitality and customer focus at Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar was simply outstanding! I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights last week for a business trip. One of the best I have experienced in terms of service and would definitely return.My expectations in terms of hotel cleanliness, quality of rooms, dining options and customer service were exceeded. Everywhere I went I was always greeted by a warm friendly team who were always smiling. The spa, gym, outdoor pool are really well maintained and of a very good international standard. I could see the staff at his hotel work exceptionally hard to ensure that guests have a wonderful stay. I want to take this opportunity to thank a the below members of staff whom I had the had the pleasure to meet.Manoj (Front desk) – He was always very helpful. On day 1 I required assistance to get to the office and he took time out to explain the different taxi options. He even called the taxi driver to ensure they drive into the forecourt to pick me up. Jagdish (Food and Beverage) – He always greeted me with a genuine smile during the breakfast and dinner seating. He works very hard to get to know his customers and the cuisine they like. After day 1 he had a very good idea of what I liked and would help me with the food selection. He knew exactly which beer I liked and would offer it at dinner for the remaining days. One evening he ordered me fresh naan bread, however as I took my time to eat, he came over and swapped it with another fresh basket of warm naan. Very thoughtful. Thank you.Narendra (Breakfast Manager) – Narendra is extremely polite and well spoken. He would greet me every morning during breakfast. He knew exactly what I liked for breakfast and would ensure it was ordered the moment he saw me walk into the restaurant. He is a fantastic example of a Food and Beverage Manager. Ratan (Food and Beverage) - Like Jagdish, he worked very hard to ensure all customers were kept happy. Devendra (Front Desk/hotel lobby) – Devendra would always greet visitors politely when they were in the hotel lobby. He would ask questions about their day and made an attempt to get to know and assist them.I would definitely return to this hotel as the experience was fabulous! Keep up the great work!","September 15, 2017"
"The hotel in itself is really great , considering the interiors , the service ,the staff , the cleanliness everything. The brand name is well maintained.

"I was on a holiday with my partner in india and decided to stay at crowne plaza for 2 nights in delhi.The room was big and spacious with modern decorations. Bed was soft and comfortable, and the bathroom was awesome.But what made me love this hotel is not the room / amenities - but the hotel staff itself. They were very attentive and friendly. We had the breakfast buffet and the staff there were all very caring and asks if we needed anything and such. We never felt ignored! One staff that has made an impression on us most is Devendra from front desk. He helped us in giving information on where to go for dinner and what mall is nearby. When we ordered for uber, he made sure he calls the uber driver and let him know where we are and where we are going. He even asked for our room number for security purposes. The next day when we checked out, he was there as well and still remembered who we were. Excellent service from Devendra and crowne plaza should be thankful to have him in the company!","August 28, 2017"
I've never been to India. This was my first trip. I was apprehensive about adjusting to the culture but staying at the Crowne Plaza took away all of my apprehensions. Their food selection was varied. My hotel room was comfortable. The customer service was good. Sunil from Housekeeping always made my room perfect and added a personal touch each time. :-),"August 26, 2017"
It was very good to book this hotel room from TripAdvisor .my business trip was successful by this only as I have been leaving and coming into room at a fixed time it was very pleasant to 2 live in this hotel for 2 days it was a nice experience as I have as as as it is good staff facility and the food facilities is also very good I prefer all my friends to use Trip Advisor to book a hotel for any of the purposes,"August 22, 2017"
"We stayed in this hotel for just 1 night. The hotel is Fantastic with excellent staff members. The entire staff of the hotel is very sensitive towards your requirements and will do everything to fulfil & are ready to go an extra mile for it. We stayed in a room on the 9th Floor and the view from the room was just awesome. The rooms are also very spacious and all the basic amenities are available. The swimming pool is also big enough and I must say that the hotel keeps the water filter plant always on so that you get clean water at anytime of the day. Their spa is also just amazing. The food served is also amazingly tasteful and the spread of buffet is mind blowing. Though if you order from the menu, the dishes seemed to be a little overpriced. Overall my stay has been very comfortable and I will definitely come again with my family. Recommend for all.","August 20, 2017"
"I stayed in this hotel for 6 months whilst working in Noida and they were fantastic!Being away from home for so long can be difficult but they made me feel so welcome. The rooms were big and spacious and cleaned impeccably every day. I ate in the restaurant most nights and the food was amazing! Thank you to the chef for making me a special 3 course meal.......and all the little surprise ice creams. It was delicious! The drivers were fabulous, especially Ajay who gave me lots of fantastic places to visit and for advising me of the indian cookery classes! Thank you again to all the fantastic staff in the hotel and I hope to see you soon .......","August 16, 2017"
"Crowne Plaza Mayur vihar reflects true Indian Hospitality. It is warmth feeling from check in to check out. Service is excellent and breakfast choices are good. It is close to Noida, if you have business to do in Noida, it can be your choice. You have to go to some distance, if you want to eat out. of course, you have nice dining choice at Crowne Plaza and next door HolidayInn. There is nice open pool in third floor, along with gym and Spa. There are two metro stations on each side, in walkable distance.","August 14, 2017"
This is a one of its kind best place to stay if you are visiting or on business travel to Noida. Overall comfortable stay. Good food and breakfast. But it's away from airport hence to and from airport travel has to be planned carefully with approximately 2 hours during peak hours easily. ,"August 14, 2017"
"Overall the service was excellent. The rooms are clean and housekeeping is spot on. I thoroughly enjoyed my room. The location was excellent for me as it was less than 5 minutes drive to the office building i was visiting. There's a bar/lounge and a restaurant on the ground floor. My colleague and I tried their buffet dinner and the food was delicious. As far as I am concerned, the amenities are world-class.What I liked best about this hotel is the staff. We met some really pleasant reception staff such as Miss Sharma, Miss Nidhi & Mr Sunil. They offered us flawless services and made our stay very comfortable.","August 12, 2017"
"I stayed here for a couple of days on Business and was treated very well. The staff were friendly and made sure that all my needs were met with out a fuss. This place is a fine example of what motivated employees can do get guests coming back again. The food was excellent and the spread was good for the price ,that we pay for the Buffet..","August 5, 2017"
"Hi here I'm, once again want to share my experience with the infinity restaurant's chef Ashish. I ordered a cake for my niece's birthday on the 28th july and this time too as it was the last time the cake was too delicious. Chef Ashish was so good with his work that he exactly made the cake in the way i wanted him to. My niece is 6 years old now and like every girl she's all into barbies, make up kits etc. I had an idea for im my mind for her cake which i shared with chef Ashish. He not only helped me out in suggesting the best flavours to be used but healthy too. Thank you very much chef Ashish for such a wonderful experience.","July 30, 2017"
Although the Hotel is Good but the staff is little unprofessional and hotel lacks on few of the current basic needs like Mobile charger.This Hotel does not have any rooms with health faucet which causes a lot of inconvenience.,"July 22, 2017"
I stayed there in September 2016 for a couple of days. The stay was very comfortable. Rooms are big and nice. The room service food was very good and staff polite but unintrusive. The buffet breakfast is one of the best. Somehow the staff knew what I would prefer and seemed to pamper me. Would recommend definitely.,"July 15, 2017"
"Stayed in Crown plaza in Delhi, I must say it was pleasant and very much relaxing.If you are looking for a place near Pragathi maidan, Akshardham. This place will be much ideal.Staff were really supportive and they have very good buffet breakfast.","July 13, 2017"
The best hotel I've visited till now. This hotel is known for the Hospitality which is more than what a person expects. The staff are very polite and carry a smile that's very nice. I love the complimentary buffet which was not for namesake. Chocolate pancake is a must try option for anyone who stay here. The swimming pool is clean and you have staff to always assist you.I was amazed by the punctuality of the cabdrivers and when I left the staff give a good sendaway. Thank you very Crowne plaza team for the service.,"June 30, 2017"

"I am happy to EDIT my review after my recent visit to the property. It's nice to see how the property is trying hard to get back to the glory. I was very happy to see eye on details ""installation of fragrance out side the hotel to avoided the bad smell for guest The staff is more charged up, rooms are nice. Must take a minute to appreciate !Previous review : The reason of giving 3 stars : I have seen this hotel loosing it's charm over 4 yeas. This management and name of the hotel Changes and it had worked bad for the property. ","June 21, 2017"
"I have now stayed at this hotel twice. Rooms are very good, large, clean, bright, air conditioning works great, especially which it is 45C/114F. Staff is very helpful and open the gym for me extra early. Gym Staff and equipment was quite good. When I needed help the front desk staff was very informative. Got to use the pool for a bit very nice. Wish it was open later or at least wish I could have sat outside later in the evening.Restaurant was good, buffet very nice. If you stay there more than a couple of days, the buffet can get old and there really isn't anywhere else to go easily without taking a car. Perhaps the Holiday Inn next store. The restaurant staff was really helpful when I needed anything.The area is secure, but the area outside is a little odd, there is a mall next door that seems to be only liquor stores. There is an ATM in the mall, but I wouldn't go there after dark, doesn't feel safe.Easy location, I have enjoyed my staff and the facilities.","June 21, 2017"
"I stayed in this hotel with my family for a fortnight in June 2017. It was an official trip. The stay was very pleasant. The room was very neat and clean, well maintained. The reception was very cordial. All the staffs from top to bottom are very respectful, cordial and cooperative. The food in the dining is very nice. A good variety available and food is palatable. All the staffs in the dining are very respectful and caring and affectionate. I would like to mention two names especially Mr Deepak and Mr. Diwas the chefs who have taken a lot of care of us. They have prepared foods of our choice without any hesitation any time we have asked for. As such all the staffs in the dining have taken care of us. This hotel is worth staying. I have seen nationals of different countries staying happily in this hotel.The hotel management and the staffs are very experienced and they take care of all the necessities and requirements. They know their business very well.","June 21, 2017"
A good hotel with nice staff. Must mention about the huge spread at the buffet and the chef always welcome anything additional items that you need. Rooms are large with good corner place to work. Beds are very comfortable. Especially like the mild room spray available for a sound sleep.,"June 12, 2017"
"I have nothing but praise for the extremely courteous staff - what one would call ""customer delight"". Their decor is terrific and ambience is very classy and not in your face. Without doubt, a great place in East Delhi, and close to NOIDA","June 7, 2017"

"It was a flying visit to Delhi and an overnight flight to get there, I regret I was only half awake when I arrived at the Crowne Plaza at 5 in the morning so didn't thank the attentive staff, I was placed in a comfortable seat and the whole check in process brought to me. My bag was in my room when I was taken up to it. So to those staff that were on the night shift 24th May to the morning of 25th Thank you for your attention and I apologise for not thanking you at the time but the arms of Morpheus were calling","May 27, 2017"
"High class service, excellent rooms, mine was a ""non smoking"" king bed"" room number 722, facing the pool.......housekeeping was excellent ,the staff at the hotel entrance n lobby n reception area all provide best in class service.I traveled with my family n it was a memorable stay.Highly recommend this hotel ofcourse Delhi is a big place so it should suit your travel purpose and location needs....but since new ashok nagar metro is walking distance SO access to new Delhi and noida areas [ like CP, KAROL BAGH , N NOIDA SECTOR 18] gets very convenient bcoz of metroswimming pool and steam shower rooms very well maintained. I didn't try the food n restaurants here but should be good no doubt about it.","May 24, 2017"
"I've travelled intensely throughout India on business trips but the hospitality I received at this property was just awesome..Fast checkin procedure, great room, Best Room Service and Housekeeping services. I will definately recommend this property to all business and even leisure travellers.. 3 cheers","May 23, 2017"
"The quality of Buffet is Very Good.(May be a little improvement required for the dessert section)Levels of spice just perfect.THE FOOD IS SUMPTUOUS! The staff is well behaved, prompt and on-their-toes.Would surely recommend dining here in case one is around esp with Foreign Guests.","May 18, 2017"
"Well, for people who travel a lot for work and Business, maybe this is not the right place. Seemingly the feeling of comfort - not to agree for the service lacunae and then the authoritarian attitude - kind of having made a mark - let me dwell into the saga a la kingfisher airlines.","May 17, 2017"
Its a great hotel and restra. Very good facelty over there. And there are aslo very good staff and other person. He is loceted in mayur vihar. There are more and more good atmosfare very much ...too good,"May 13, 2017"
This was our first hotel in India and will be our last we didn't know what to expect but wow fabulous place the rooms spacious and comfortable bed a little to hard for me however bearable the bar was welcoming and cocktails were strong the food was good friendly staff willing to help in any which way looking forward to spending our last evening there soon,"May 13, 2017"
"Stayed for a couple of nights as it's located close to my office in Noida. The welcome of the staff was warm and genuine and the service at all times was of a high standard. The rooms are a good size and the layout is practical and makes them feel spacious. The bathrooms have a large window (with blinds) that lets in some natural light. My room was on the 12th floor and the view was impressive. The rooms are really quiet and very dark when the curtains are closed. The bed was amazingly soft and comfortable which was perfect for me. A bonus was being able to check-in as soon as I arrived from the airport early in the morning. I tried the spa and pool, both of which are very nice and well maintained. I only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was what you'd expect from a hotel like this. Not amazing, but good, fresh and tasty. One negative is that the hotel transport is expensive for the distances travelled. Taxis also seemed expensive from this hotel compared to others I've stayed at in Delhi. Probably something to do with it being outside the city centre. I would happily stay again. ","May 13, 2017"
"I stayed in this hotel for my business trip and it was a good experience to stay there than I expected. It was a first time to visit in India and no idea how my stay will be, but my room was a quite large, amenities were good, and WiFi environment was also great. I could spend time with relaxed and work hard during the stay.","May 6, 2017"
Good location if you want to work / base in NOIDA. Good comfortable and well planned rooms with mostly everything taken care off. (The beds are a little too soft ! Wish there was a way to change that). Good staff. Soothing and peaceful ambiance.,"May 3, 2017"

"The room are quite big and above all clean.Another good factor is the silent inside the room, you can sleep very well, also thanks to different pillows.Breakfast form 6:30 to 10:00 and you can have almost you can need.Spa and pool are also available - not used.Last but not leas, personnel are very kind.","April 24, 2017"
"Really, I can't find one single unpleasant thing to say. Apart from the huge drain opposite the hotel (which is not the hotel's fault!), this is an exemplary hotel that really takes care of its guests. Great service, a lovely room with luscious pillows and a sumptuous bed, great bath amenities and fantastic water pressure... this was an excellent choice. The FOH was highly helpful and gracious while the Security was professional and pleasant. I truly appreciated the little, handwritten message left by Housekeeping. It would be good though if the hotel can offer shuttle service to the nearby Metro Station abt 500 metres away. All in all a great experience. I'd gladly return.","April 23, 2017"
"Crown Plaza is an excellent hotel for those of us traveling from abroad. Typical high end service. Rooms clean and bathrooms were upscale. Food quality and choices were good. Excellent service.Just a few issues that I encountered: There was confusion during booking if breakfast is included in the rate. The portal I booked through showed breakfast but it ended up being not included.I had planned on staying for 10 days and made two separate bookings. I decided to cancel the 2nd booking mainly because although breakfast had lot of variety, it basically was the same each day and it got boring after eating the same stuff 5 days in a row. I wish they can do something about making breakfast more distinct each day.Finally, although I had cancelled the 2nd booking within cancellation timeframe and had online email confirmation, the hotel charged me for it. It took 3 months through the credit card dispute to finally get the charge off.I had stayed during the midst of demonitization and the hotel refused to cash even small amount. Lastly, the lighting in the rooms is very dim. Probably to give upscale look. It would help to have the option for bright light to do work.Other than this the hotel is a good place to stay for comfort and service. Since I worked night (US Shift) and slept during the day, the staff was still able to clean the room during late evenings when I was at work. Many other hotels are not able to do this.","April 19, 2017"
Its rare to see in India for staff to know bout vegan lifestyle but this place gets it thanks to the supreme and magnifique services of Rattan and his amazing crew at infinity. They smiled they wanted effortlessly giving their best at all tables. Beware we solo diners observe a lot more!!! I noticed all Chef's were on restaurant floor assisting the guests don't see that much. My entire meal was veganised easily. Even when a minor glitch that resulted in me having dairy occurred I was quickly apologised to and cautioned. Rattan the star has a warm smile that is welcoming like no other. He is irresistibly handsome and suave which made him professional flirty!! All this would be secondary without consequence if the food was just good. It was more than divine. Try the stuffed mushrooms unbelievably surprising having had every Indian dish in 6 yrs this was an execution rare and the homestyle gobi paranta by Chef Ashish who personally checked on my satisfaction and gave me the trade recipe of the mushrooms. Mahalo and thanks to this unexpected Sunday treat will be back soon. The kir Royal Hmmm needs a better recipe the restaurant decor dated. ,"April 16, 2017"

I ordered a cake at the infinity restaurant @ crowne plaza. I contacted Chef Diwas who asked me to find out any cake on google and watsapp him its pic. As all other boys my son also likes cars so i shared few pics with chef. Mr. Diwas helped me out choosing the right cake basis the weight of the cake. He further shared chef. Ashish's contact number who took the rest of the details and prepared the cake.The cake was handed over to me before time and it looked exactly the same in reference to the pic i shared.Everybody my family and relatives loved everything in the cake starting from its design to its taste.This was my first experience with Chef Diwas and his team and I'll continue it further in future.Kudos and my best wishes to chef Diwas and his team for future.,"March 28, 2017"
"We stayed in this hotel and were particularly impressed with the manner the place is run . All staff appear to take great pride in their work and the minute u walk into the hotel one feels very welcome . Good security exists as every time you enter the hotel a security check is carried out . The room we stayed in was big , airy with all the usual facilities including a safe . The bedding was crisp and clean and very good quality towels and toiletries were provided . I found the breakfast as one of the best in India as we had been travelling all over in the previous 3 weeks . There was a very big choice and this hotel caters for many different nationalities. The location of this hotel is good and not far from a metro station . I would definitely stay in this hotel when again in Delhi . ","March 25, 2017"
"This is a very beautiful, clean and modern hotel. The rooms are very spacious with very modern bathrooms, equipped with large bath tub and a separate shower.It was also close to the metro and the highway.The food from the dinning room was amazing, our breakfast was included but we opted to have dinner there also because the buffet has so many choices and tasted delicious. The best thing about this hotel was the staff, the dinning room and front desk staff. They were very efficient, helpful and very friendly. I will definitely stay there again.","March 24, 2017"
"I am checking out in the next 30 min - and wanted to thank the following team members of yours - 1) Arshad, Abhishek and Ajith at bell desk . They are always keen to help. Abhishek is very forthcoming -Arshad got me the printouts of the IHG hotels at Las Vegas . I am travelling there next month and wanted to book myself at a IHG property.2) Sunil and Devendra at Concierge . Sunil went out of the way to help me pack a gods photograph for me - which is supposed to go as a gift to someone. God bless him. Earlier during my stay Mr Rahul Sharma touched my heart by personally ensuring that a gift packet from my mentor reaches Mr Ranjan Banerjee - GM Okhla. 3) Suraj , Shoovir and Gaurav - your brand new IT team were top class. Always smiling !4) Anil from housekeeping was a God send . Every morning as soon as I stepped out of my room for some help - he was there to always help me. He is a diligent and silent worker . Great asset .He would also place fresh flowers on my Guruji's picture every day ( without me asking for it ).5) The chef brigade and Infinity was better than ever before . Chef Mayaram took special care of me . Every morning he would prepare my Upma and come to check if it's fine . On 2 occasions he tied some interesting innovations - Bewdi and Wheat Upma. Chef Deepak , Kunwar were all very impressive. Shakthi and Tarun never cease to impress me with their creativity . Every evening I would come for dinner and request them to make me something ' light and flavourful' - and they will take care Of he rest . God bless both of them . The wholly wheat and asparagus warm salad by chef Shakthi and the braised vegetables made last night by chef Tarun were my Top 2 dinners during this stay.6) The service team and Infinity is like family to me . I saw some new boys this time - they are all very good - Asad, Jagdish, Mohan and Sujith . The seniors are as good as ever - Sanjay, Vinod Hoshiyar, Digamber, Narender and Punit - including Roshni. 7) Lalit and Avinash in IRD. Lalit served my fruits and milk everyday . Avinash was super sharp to replenish the almonds in my room on time.8) Manoj Kumar at security would wish me every morning with folded hands and a heart full of respect . 9) Amit, Shama and Deepak are the best. So professional and helpful. Great team . I feel comfortable calling them any time for help. Sundeep impressed me by giving me a list of Raymonds Showrooms near the hotel. Thanks to Manoj and Rakesh for a seamless checkout experience. Rakesh also offered me chance for RS 2000 on my way out .10) Sunil and Sultan from Laundry were superstars . Every evening they would come and deliver my laundry with military precision and minimum disturbance .Great stay as ever- thanks again.Pls let the above team members know that I am thankful to them for the time and attention they gave me. My regards to Chef Devas as well. He is an amazing human being .Regards ","March 24, 2017"

"I've stayed repeatedly at the Crowne Plaza in Noida (not in New Delhi, which is 20-25 minutes away by Metro or taxi, depending on traffic), in large part because of its proximity to both Indira Gandhi International Airport and downtown Delhi. With my 9 nights stay there over the past several years, I continually have been impressed with the facility and the high quality of service. Admittedly, there isn't much around the hotel except the Holiday Inn next door, but one can walk 10 minutes to the Metro station easily seen from and, for less than 20 rupies be in Delhi in no time. And admittedly, there have been a few mornings when the smell from the Yamuna River creeps into the lobby unpleasantly. But having spent over five weeks in India on both business and holiday travel, I haven't slept better in a single hotel. Whereas most Indian hotel mattresses are rocks, the down-top cushion at the Crown Plaza wins. The front desk was always helpful; our only challenge came with exchanging money in February, but we discovered that cash was tight in India because of the national elections. Breakfasts came with our rate, and the buffet is extensive with both Indian and Western options, including made-to-order omelets and dosas, which were delicious. While other reviews have noted the lack of restaurant options surrounding the hotel, the restaurant's dinner selections, both when choosing the buffet and ordering off the menu, had us return night after night -- yes, in part because of the ease after a day of touring, but also because of the top quality service. Our gratitude to Narendra, the assistant manager of the restaurant, who was conscientious and always helpful. Room amenities were top-notch: iron and full ironing board (not something we found in many Indian hotels), tea kettle with full tea and coffee selections, and numerous outlets (both Indian and Western) that made it easy to recharge. If you're looking for a resort experience, then I'd suggest making another choice, given the location and surrounding area, even if the hotel has all the amenities of a resort. But we'll stay here again when we revisit Delhi again.","March 11, 2017"
"Was there again and it's still has the same charm , nice ambience, good food better service and everything else so I always like to go to this place . What else you need to go to a hotel it has all the reasons to visit . Keep it up ","March 11, 2017"
"We found the room and hotel in general was fantastic, and Hotel would have received 5* from me except on the first morning when we went down for breakfast a bus tour had just finished and we we told to wait till tables were available, except a number of other people who came in after us were taken to tables - l was really pissed off and found it rude. Next morning the service breakfast service was excellent","March 5, 2017"
A very nice hotel. Staff were very friendly. I was on 10th floor with views across the flood plain of the Yamuna towards New Delhi. Rooms large and comfortably furnished. Room service menu was good - quality and a wide selection. Restaurant did a buffet in the evening for around INR 2000. The breakfast buffet was also large. Breakfast staff changed halfway through my 8 night stay and the new team had only been trained to make cappuccinos so anything more exotic (e.g. single macchiato) was beyond them. Cafe/Bar good with small outdoor terrace for smokers. The hotel has well equipped fitness center and a stylish outdoor pool on the 3rd floor. (Sun on pool area in the afternoon)The main problems are1. The hotel is located close to the Yamuna river and a sort of open sewer. The stench of sewage was quite strong outside the hotel which made the cafe terrace and pool areas not places you would want to linger but this wasn't a problem inside. The proximity to water also meant mosquitoes. There were plug-in mosquito thingies in each room. 2. There is not much around the hotel. Holiday Inn next door provide a bit of change in restaurants. There is a sort of shopping mall behind the hotel but this was full of beer and wine shops and little else - something to do with sales tax differences between Delhi and NOIDA. The market in Mayer Vihar was fine for groceries and chemist but the cafe/restaurants probably best avoided. The metro station into Delhi is a 10min walk or short TukTuk ride. Uber car into the centre took about 40mins depending on traffic. I would stay again for a night or two but not for another week stretch. ,"March 5, 2017"
World class hotel with superb facilities. Service was top notch. Hotel was extremely clean and wellmaintained. Extensive breakfast. Could not find any faults. Large rooms and a great in house dining service. Prices to match the service. My room faced easy so I got a superb view of the sun rising every morning. ,"February 23, 2017"
Spent one night here with the group in transit to Agra. Could not fault their service. Very good in all areas. The food was of a high standard. Staff willing to please. Very good facilities in the room. Would definitely stay there again.,"February 16, 2017"
"We had gone for Buffet dinner. Had a nice time. Hospitality was great. Although variety of vegetarian snacks was less as compared to non veg, I think that's cause of their foreign guests from Portugal who are more into non- veg.Quality of chicken tikka masala can do a little better. Overall it was good.","February 15, 2017"
"Located close to Noida and Delhi, the hotel is clean and comfortable. the staff are attentive and courteous even though the food at Infinity restaurant is good, less of south Indian variety disappointed","February 13, 2017"
"The services and the food has declined over a period of tome, previously with Hilton the standard by and large was much better. Ambiance of the neighborhood is below average. Staff in their coffee shop Infinity is cooperative and cordial. Overall the quality needs to improve .","February 13, 2017"
"Stayed in Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar for 3 days, on a short business trip, since it is one of the best options close to NOIDA. The hotel room was top-notch. The mattress and sheets made for very comfortable nights' sleep. The restaurant offers an excellent variety of healthy breakfast options and the dinner is even better. The staff, especially at the restaurant, were extremely courteous and ready to help, well done to the team.","February 12, 2017"
"The Crowne Plaza Mayar Vihar, should be a great hotel, sadly it rates as average, despite a good restaurant. What lets this hotel down is its attention to detail. During my most recent visit, the phone in the bedroom did not work correctly, meaning that in room dining was not able to be reached. The reception staff are more interested in flagging you as a member of the IHG system, which is quite frankly embarrassing. The hotel location is not the best, with no easy access to the metro that runs just outside the hotel. The pool terrace is called river view, but you would need binoculars to see the river. Staff in the lobby bar are unattentive, however staff in the restaurant are perfect, and this is the hotels saving grace.","February 10, 2017"
Stayed at the hotel for a night. We checked in late in the night..... the check in was smooth....the room was comfortable and cosy.....We slept well..... The breakfast at Infinity was decent.... Overall a comfortable stay.,"February 7, 2017"
"We stayed in the hotel for business working in the NOIDA area for the week. The hotel rooms are very big, and the view from the window was nice, although it's mostly of a road and train route... on good visibility days it may be better.The room was clean, and everyone in the hotel was very nice to us, breakfast buffet is lovely with a choice of Indian / continental dishes, Dosa freshly made to your specs, as well as other staple morning dishes / juices.Beds are so comfy. BTW","February 5, 2017"
"I booked this hotel because I was working in film city which is very close by. The location has nothing much around it and the views are quite plain but the hotel is fantastically staffed and the service is top notch. Security is quite good and the gym and spa level are well staffed and nicely appointed. I recommend this hotel though if you go to the mall behind the hotel, there are many shops that sell cigarettes and cheap name brand alcohol if the prices at the bar scare you off. Taxes are quite high in the area so I bought at the mall and enjoyed in my room, which quite frankly, was the very best room I've had in a long time. ","February 3, 2017"
"I was a member of their Crystal club and booking a room at the date of my choice was a big headache----- never got the date I requested! But the staff at their Infinity restaurant was great---- very helpful and courteous. The food was, well, OK! But more than made up with the behavior of the staff","February 1, 2017"
"This was the first hotel that I stayed at and it was definitely memorable. The staff was courteous, the food was delicious, one the of food managers even had special indian breakfast made for me when he was on shift. The place was cleanly and overall great stay.","January 30, 2017"
Had a wonderful say the Crowne Plaza but it was Narendra the made this stay memorable. He went out of his way to make sure I was take care of at all times to the point where I was looking forward to seeing him upon my return to the hotel. Definitely going to miss him and this hotel. ,"January 27, 2017"
"We stayed here as part of a tour, but definitely a business hotel. The wireless worked great, and there is an onsite restaurant called ""Infinity"" that serves breakfast (buffet and omelettes/eggs to order). Very secure hotel with guard and metal detector at front door, check all cars coming into hotel as well at the gate. Rooms are a good size, beds comfortable and decent size shower (water pressure and temp were good). The staff were friendly and helpful. We ate dinner at the hotel as well, al a carte, as well they have a dinner buffet. The food was good, drinks (wine) very expensive (but what you would expect at a hotel like this, and in India). There was a nice pool area, but closed for renos. Also a BBQ/bar area by the pool. We used the excercise room (good selection of machines and weights), and there is a steam/change room in the bathrooms by the spa.","January 25, 2017"
I stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks and it was a very pleasant stay. The rooms are clean and well kept. Food too was excellent. Staff at the restaurant were very professional and helpful. Especially Narendra Singh was exceptional. He was always ready to go an extra mile to please the guest . He is certainly an asset for Crowne Plaza.,"January 23, 2017"
"I stayed in this hotel for four nights. It is actually located in Noida and too far from New Delhi City Center. Metro line is just passing through this hotel. It is five minutes’ walk from New Ashoke Nagar stop. This hotel is situated a little bit outskirts of New Delhi and isolated place.This is a big hotel and has 24 hrs. Reception desk. Its breakfast is complimentary and has variety of items. Buffet system in lunch and dinner is also available. Its safety and security system for guests in unique. Room was big, neat and clean. Toilet was big enough. Everything like, tea-coffee maker, Flat screen TV, fridge, toiletries, telephone, sofa set is available in the room. They provide complimentary newspapers in the room every day. It has 24 hrs. free room service.I highly recommend this hotel for travellers to have luxury experience.","January 10, 2017"
"Good hotel. I did not care too much for the breakfast that they serve. The dinner was very expensive, so we went next door to the Holiday Inn and ate a tasty meal at an affordable price. They did not have free wifi at that time. I would still recommend it.","January 9, 2017"
"The Hotel is well located, the room was very spacious and comfortable. The Buffet at the restaurant Infinity was clearly an experience, with a lot of choices and quality. Also the restaurant staff was very professional and helpful, specially Asha who always took good care of us.We only had one day to discover Delhi, and the hotel provided us the best driver/guide we could imagine. Ajay shared his knowledge about Delhi with a lot of passion and professionalism. We were so lucky to have the opportunity to visit Delhi with someone like him. So don't forget to ask the concierge for Ajay because he is definitely the one able to make your stay in Delhi unforgettable!","January 7, 2017"
"We were upgraded to a deluxe room. Spacious floor space. Friendly staff. Excellent service. Awesome breakfast. Indian and western cuisine. I overate every morning. Puris were made to order. My favorite meal for breakfast, puri bhaji","January 6, 2017"

"I stayed at this hotel while traveling with a group of 13 family members. The hotel staff were friendly, and helpful at all times. Check in was handled well, the staff were extremely organized. The food was great. The breakfast buffet offered a wide range of options. We also had the Christmas Eve dinner buffet, and it was amazing. Mohan always did his best to make sure that we were comfortable.  The hotel isn't too far away from the downtown area, but it is very close to the mall of India. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely use it again. ","December 30, 2016"
"Stayed 15 nights in this hotel and one word to share my experience ""Awesome""!It was a perfect location for my work in Noida and near Delhi for fun and shopping. Bedrooms were enough spacious. Swimming pool, gym & spa, steam bath & sauna were totally a great experience. Infinity food court have had yummy cuisines. But the best part of this hotel are its staff! They all were friendly, many smiling faces and always having great energies to help anytime during the stay.As I traveled India from Finland after over two years, I was eager to speak to people around. I never expected staff would make me feel like home!Ritu had been outstanding with her morning & evening greetings in lobby and knowing day to day welfare at my end, ensured my stay to be as pleasant possible. A very talented FM!Narendra & Sanjay ensured that food served in morning and evening at its best, totally fulfilling cuisines, specially when I am being a vegetarian. Kudos narendra!Roshni and Aasha were exceptional in their roles.

"This is a great hotel to stay on a business trip. Close to Noida and away from the big hustle and bustle of Delhi. There's a metro stop nearby, taxi's (Uber/Ola) are also readily available. The breakfast is a good mix of Indian and western choices. As mentioned in other reviews, the location is not near the Airport, it is a good one hour ride without traffic. A great place to stay if you are working in or around Noida.","December 21, 2016"
"The hotel is just another 5 star hotel. However, the chefs here are too good. Not only they service the best to you, they ensure to service as per your needs. One such chef that we met was Deepak. He was extremely customer centric & gave us an excellent service. Best part was when he stated ""We are away from our hometown, hence he was trying to give us his best not to let us miss our home. The veg pizza & Chicken Biryani that he exclusively made for us was unmatchable. It was unforgettable moment.Thanks Deepak once again","December 20, 2016"

So New Delhi is not for the faint of heart. This property is a good distance from the airport - allow an hour at least and closer to two hours at rush hour (in fact save yourself some grief and do not take a flight that lands at 4 or 5 pm on a Friday). One tip - Uber is alive and well in New delhi and it's about $10 from the airport to the hotel. I think the hotel car was about 25 times more expensive. The room was good sized. The bellman is insistent about helping with your bags. The bathroom was quite nice.The front desk spoke limited English. The restaurant was also limited in English.The hotel is changing their phones - or so the note said. In any case the phones didn't work and when they did they went unanswered at the front desk (and when finally answered they can't understand English so ... a little trying). The wifi and the A/C were excellent.At checkout the bag valet was great and very helpful so that varies day to day.Bottom line - it's fine. You can do better.,"December 18, 2016"
"We could not fault the service, the room or the restaurant, it really is a great hotel. The only thing to consider is the location which is a little out of the way of the things you may want to do in Delhi and other eating alternatives.","December 17, 2016"
"I have came here on a business trip and staying in this amazing hotel near my office. The Hotel has wide and spectacular view all around but the one through the swimming pool side is absolutely awesome. I am amazed with the hospitality of the Hotel stuff. They are so nice friendly and always let me feel at home. Specially Deepak , who is a fantastic chef in this hotel always come with grand new dishes specially for me with my home flavor. Even if my stomach is full he never stop putting his creation. One who comes here must meet him and i am sure you will never try to find another hotel to stay.Also one day when i came back from Office , fully tired and needed a break, i found the house keeping stuff Bobby made Swan with Towel and put at the table. This was magical. I forgot all the stress of the day seeing that craft. This is something I never expected from hotel service.Thanks Deepak for the nice dishes , your creation and Thanks Bobby. I wish I could carry the Swan to home.. :-)Tanmay","December 13, 2016"

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the staff members starting with Rahul Sharma (great leader & motivator), Deepak & Amit (Front Desk Managers), Chef Diwas, Chef Deepak Mahananda, Chef Shakti, Chef Manjeet, Chef Tarun (great food & personalized experience).My special words of appreciation for Chef Deepak Mahananda (thanks for making yummy food), Narender, Digamber (Restaurant Managers), Ratan, Vinod, Sanjay, Asha (Restaurant staff), Sunil, Rakesh (Transport Team) and Anil (Orix) – they always serve with a smile & brighten my day.I would also like to thank the entire room cleaning staff as well as front desk staff – including Dev, Ajit etc.Thank You all for making me feel as if I am at my home only; Look forward to my next stay !!!","December 13, 2016"
"They randomly started construction to fix something in the room above from 4-5:30pm and we had to call three times to complain asking them to stop and asked if they could work on it for another 30 or so minutes. I said ""no"" bc we just got back from our sightseeing and we're tired and we're trying to nap. They kept saying they would have it stop but after every call the banging continued making us crazy especially from lack of sleep from traveling here from the other side of the world.They said they would stop and then after complaining agai said they wouldn't. Very frustrating! Never said at any hotel where this has happened and I've traveled all over the world all my life.

After Crown plaza kochi it was second visit to any Crown plaza property.

This was the first time i was staying at this Crowne Plaza property and was looking forward to the same. The property lived up to its expectations and service in all aspects. A special mention is however merited for :the in-room dining the person realised i was not too well and had a severe cough as i requested for a piece of ginger. not only was a cleaned piece sent but also some complementary ginger tea. .. truly a thoughtful and a welcome gesturethe steward and chef during breakfast. not only did they remember what i had order the previous day but also the crispiness of the waffle. a warm .. friendly .. and a professional hotel,"December 5, 2016"

"It has been indeed pleasure to stay at crowne plaza, Mayur viharThe overall service is very good. The directors were easily approachable and the front desk members are really helpfulThe room,food, needs based on preference are too good","November 28, 2016"
"I have travelled with business to this hotel in November 2016. I have been checked-in in room 910. My overall impression is a very good one, of course there are some strong parts as well as improvements.First the good parts:1. The beds and pillows provide extraordinary comfort for sleeping. Somehow soft but with back support (I had no back pains in the mornings). Pillows have the correct size (not inexistent but not too big to get neck pains). By far the most comfortable bed I have slept in.2. The restaurant has a very good menu, decent priced. The food is very tasty, in particular the pasta has been correctly prepared.3. The staff is carefull, after just 2 days they remember your preferences (if you can call them that after 2 days) and they greet you in a nice, warm and personal approach.4. The room is very well dimensioned (in my case for a 1 week stay): there is a big bathroom, the bed area (with the TV) and then a kind of office place near the big window with a big desk, a small coffee table and a sofa - which is a good place for reading as well.5. Good selection of TV programs, with quite some options for the international travellers.6. The floors are quiet in order for you to enjoy reading, listening to some music or sleeping.Now for the improvements:1. Considering the location it would be usefull to have some organized trips from the hotel (using the Toyota Innova for a group of 5 people) to key landmarks (like the Taj Mahal). I found the individual transfer to this location is quite expensive: ~18000 rupees + tax (~280$). Organizing small groups would make it more efficient.2. The wallpaper in the room was starting to come off near the bathroom windows. I do not believe it was related to mold, as there was no bad smell in the room, but more to the fact that the glue did not behave well at the horizontal edge of walls (toward the bathroom, but inside the room). 3. The breakfast included is a bit ""static"". The selection of food is good, but there is no variation from day to day.PS: there is a pool, I have not tried it but it looks good. My room was on the pool-side of the hotel.PPS: not sure how the other side looks like it, but on the side I was located, apart from the pool below, the area does not offer much - it is mainly infrastructure-view (elevated train, highway, other roads, deserted land). On the higher floors there is though a nice view when it gets dark since all you can see is the traffic scenery.","November 28, 2016"
"This is excellent hotel, super courteous staff, spacious rooms, comfortable beds, very clean hotel, Great choices of breakfast and dinner, love my 4 night stay. Without hesitation I would recommend this lovely hotel to any foreign or local traveler.","November 27, 2016"
"We stayed one night only. The location is a bit far away from the city and the airport, but it's ideal if you wanna have a break from the madness outside and simply relax in comfortable rooms. The reception staff is very welcoming and nice. They made sure everything was correctly prepared for our stay and even organized a dinner option for us. They also gave us suggestion on the SPA services. Rooms are spacious and nicely presented. It was my first time in a Crowne Plaza and I won't regret it for sure! ","November 23, 2016"
"Crowne Plaza offers exactly what you expect. Rooms are spacious, bed is super comfy and washroom is just over the top. Furniture are in marble and dark wood, lighting system cosy and warm.Visit the spa at the 3rd floor: treatments are very good and prices are affordable. The manager of the spa is super friendly and cares about his customer. We detox after one week in India, steam and sauna are fantastic.The buffet for the dinner needs improvement: as often happens with buffets at crowne plaza the food is average and the desserts all taste the same: sugar.Recommended but of course is not a budget hotel.","November 23, 2016"
"This is a super hotel to stay at. It is located about 7 mins walk from a metro station.I stayed here, as I was working in sector 62 of Noida and it was a 20 min journey to work.The hotel can offer airport pickup and drop-off services.My whole stay here was lovely.Staff were great, the room was lovely and large, amnple space to work and to relax.The bathroom was a good size, with all the additional shampoo's, creams and soap thrown in.The TV was a good size with a long lengthy list of channels.I was on the 12th floor and it was quite, I couldn't hear the din of the outside traffic.The airconditioning was nice and modern and very quiet, which helped me get a very good night sleep.There was a gym, which I went to and it was good.Only issue - the bed was far too soft for me, but other than that - a lovely place to stay.","November 20, 2016"
Very good service level! and a very friendly staff ... but only one main restaurant (on top of the bar & room service) so when you stay several nights it becomes unsufficient in term of offer... Otherwise very good choice!,"November 20, 2016"
"Unlike the usual in your face luxury hotels in India, the staff here is pleasant, helpful and discreetly out of the way. The rooms are fabulous with very soft comfortable beds and a cozy comforter. The view out of the window was not great, but for a business trip hotel, fussing I am not expected to spend to much time until he room. Internet connectivity was adequate at a synchronous 2Mbits I could get my work done.Well appointed gym with good equipment, did not try the pool as the water was cold. ","November 20, 2016"

"Rooms were spacious and clean. We stayed for three nights in the hotel. Gym and Pool area were really handy considering the heat of Delhi. Bar service was excellent. I need to mention that Naresh, who was in charge of the bar when I was there, provided us with an exceptional service and attitude. After this hotel I kept on travelling India but I have to say that the staff service and the breakfast food were immaculate. Definitely coming back to the same hotel when traveling to Delhi.","November 7, 2016"

I feel really bad the way Crown Plaza Mayur Vihar treated me. being a loyal and reguler customer, they should have done it and i believe its not so difficult .on other side People are very nice in restaurant and they look after you well !! front office people should learn and understand how to keep loyal customer satisfied, really disappointed this time !!!","November 4, 2016"

"I stayed in Crown Plaza, Mayur Vihar from 20-Sep to 25-Sep for Business purpose. Very happy with the overall service received during the 5 days stay. As I have mentioned in the title, 'Personalized Service' is their speciality. They will always make you feel important. This treatment is not only limited to check in but throughout all departments like restaurant, housekeeping, etc. They keep track of their members and extend a few complimentary benefits to them. Unlike some other hospitality groups,one need not remind them every-time about being loyal customerI had requested for early check in and it was duly honored. While I was waiting for the room for 15 minutes, seeing that I had a long travel, I was offered tea/coffee. During the breakfast, the chef suggested me try a speciality dish and it really turned out to be an excellent one. The rooms were big and very clean. The house keeping staff is very quick to address all your requirements. During my stay, I had taken both, in room dining and had a buffet dinner at the restaurant. The preparations were excellent and it was very difficult to avoid the temptations of not having such a treat. I am traveling frequently nationally and internationally. This was certainly one of the best experiences I had. I would certainly like to go there again.","October 26, 2016"
"Staff at the hotel are a delight, they cannot do enough for you from the doormen to the reception. Special mention to the gentleman at breakfast in a suit and Ashil the concergie who arranged our transport to Agra. Rooms are amazing, the bed provided me with one of the best nights sleep I've ever had. The buffet in the evening was not to my taste but breakfast was fantastic. We ate in the bar of the room service menu another evening and the food was lovely. Only complaint which is nothing to do with the hotel just unfortunate and worth baring in mind, the hotel is close to a river which smell is horrendous. I've never smelt something so bad before and the corridors of the hotel and the pool area do smell but the rooms do not.","October 24, 2016"

Good hospitality and food. I loved the food options and the level of service. I recommend this hotel to one and all. I stayed here on a business trip and was vowed by the hospitality and food. View from the room was not as great but everything else was. Rooms were very quiet.,"October 17, 2016"
"I recently traveled on business to New Delhi.This hotel was excellent!Rooms were outstanding & so comfortableThe hotel staff was so polite & helpful.Concierge was excellent.The food was top quality, the staff in the restaurant really go out of their way & are very helpful.The only negative is that the hotel is very isolated & nothing nearby. Additionally in my opinion the dinner buffet was very expensive for a single person.I would definitely recommend this hotel, however refer to maps to see where you will be based in relation to where you need to visit. As we had on average over 1.5 hour traveling daily.","October 16, 2016"
"Tip 1: Watch out for the wooden plinth that the security machine is situated on. I didn't, tripped over it and broke the filter on my camera. My fault I know but you need to know these things. Now on to the restaurant. A group of 4 including myself went to dine. It was busy so the person who greeted us suggested that we wait in the lounge bar and she would come and get us in 15-20 minutes. She didn't. After 25 minutes we decided to try again and were shown to a booth that had just been vacated. I'm 6ft tall and I had to sit on a cushion! Something I've not done since I was in primary school! The booths are not suitable for the buffet style dining in offer. Either the person at the back has to wait until one of the guests sitting alongside them has finished or they have to ask one of them to get out so they can get out. Waiting staff were slow to clear the table, something we had not previously experienced on this trip to India where typically it was the opposite and you were fighting to keep your plate. On one occasion one of our party stacked the dirty plates and another took them to the adjacent bar and left them on there so that we could continue our meal. A waiter also offered us a bottle of complimentary water. He had to be told several times that this was not wanted, even after he had opened the bottle. Compared tom a previous stay on this trip in another hotel in the same group that was of a lower grade, the lower grade gets the better rating. ","October 16, 2016"
I stayed in this property on a business trip.i got impressed with the exceptional personalised service of the front office manager she sets the perfect example of hospitality. There was a problem in wifi and telephone lines and i had to send important email she helped me in providing hotspot and gave me her phone for making an call which shows her genuine care towards customer needs. ,"October 10, 2016"

The room, the service, the food, the ambiance every thing was fantastic.I would like to thank the staff who are amazing.

Thanks Ritu and staff for a present surprise on my Birthday.","October 8, 2016"
The hotel lobby was great. The hotel room was very spacious and clean. The all you can eat buffet was amazing with all the different variety of foods available. The staff was very helpful and we enjoyed our stay in Delhi.,"October 7, 2016"
"I found this hotel very good for a recent 4 day business visit. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable. The desk is well laid out for computer work. Lots of plugs for all your devices. The breakfast and dinner buffets are excellent! The lounge had good appies (but I wouldn't suggest ordering cocktails). Overall, all staff worked really hard to provide efficient service (mostly that worked out). I'll stay here again next time.","October 4, 2016"

"Delivers all that is required of a good business hotel! Quick and easy check-in/check-outs, well appointed rooms with clean linen and a big breakfast spread! Service was good even during the breakfast and you didn't have to remind them twice for anything. Would keep coming again for sure!","September 30, 2016"
"The room, the food and the gym were very good, but the service from all the personnel was beyond excellent in my experience. Location is not ideal, but the hotel can provide cab services.Remember to ask about the food if you do not want to have a spicy surprise :)","September 28, 2016"
Service and staff is great and very friendly and helpful. But management really needs to improve taste and food quality. Also the passage and the lifts need great improvement. Not efficient like other crowne Plaza. ,"September 26, 2016"

"Situated strategically near the highway if you are traveling to Agra. Hence you do not need to get stuck in traffic much. I didn't get stuck in any traffic traveling into town for the 4 days I was in Dehli, although I have to say we were fortunate that we arrived on a weekend and it was a public holiday. Wonderful hospitality and loved everything about the hotel. The only downside is their breakfast buffet. Everyday we got the same menu. ","September 13, 2016"
The hospitality was awesome though the variety of food for the buffet was sadly not much. Seen much better spreads! Also the air conditioning was terrible !We had to shift our table three times because of the inefficiency of the air conditioning,"September 12, 2016"
"We used Crowne Plaza as our starting point for our holiday in Rajastan. The staff were helpful and gave us all the guidance. The resturant served a very good spread for breakfast and dinner,Ideally located to make a quick get away on the Delhi- Agra Expressway.","September 10, 2016"
"Had a business trip and spent a week at the hotel Check in and Checkout - very fast and efficient much faster and efficient than the Raddison blue and Marriott courtyard Food - very good , specially that thandoori oven they have serves some amazing Nans. Not much of a variety day in day out but what they serve is very good . Service - each of the staff members at the restaurant remembered me by name and greeted me as such which I thought was fantastic , the restaurant Manager I think his name was Vikash actually packed breakfast for me as I had to leave early for a meeting ... Which I hadn't experienced before in either of the other two hotels I've stayed at Internet - could be faster , had a few issues here . Raddison had the best internet connection Spa/gym/pool were excellent and out of the three this hotel provides better facilities Rooms - as good as Radisson or even bigger much better than courtyard two nice king-size beds !! The finishing in the rooms could better Overall fantastic and out of the three hotels I've stayed at , Crowne plaza takes the lead ! ","September 10, 2016"
Very strategically located and easy to approach. The ambiance is good. The view from Pool Side is simply 'magnificent'. Excellent customer serviceTaste-wise food is average. Spread of food items on the buffet needs to be broadened. Desserts were also lacking appeal.,"August 29, 2016"
stayed here for one night in August 2016. Rooms were clean and modern and beds were comfortable Breakfast was good and the choice was adequate. Service was very good and even though we arrived at 2am and there weren't enough towels in the room they came immediately.Note that location is out of the city so its good if your travelling (we landed at the airport and slept there and continued north by car the next day)- if you want to be in the centre then I am not sure this is the location you would choose,"August 28, 2016"
"I must start by saying there are some excellent aspects to this hotel - the customer service, the swimming pool/spa, the restaurant and the rooms are all excellent. However, there are also some irksome aspects, including the smell outside the hotel (inside it seems to be masked by the aircon), the bizarre WiFi policy and their insistence that when checking out guests pay for services incurred by separate payments rather than all together - this turns checking out into a long and laborious process.","August 28, 2016"

Wife speed was excellent..I highly recommend this hotel who wants to visit Akshardham, delhi..hotel quit near from temple and very near from mayur vihar phase 1 metro station...","August 23, 2016"
"I am reviewing it only for the purpose of veg Buffet lunch served. I visited the place with my family for a birthday celebration. Only two snacks were available. The same were average. The rest of the food was bland and very average or maybe a disaster at least for persons having good taste bud. Even the golgappas served were total bland. Even the corner shop serves golgappas better. The kids remarked that the food is as if the chef was not having taste buds. Even the desserts were poorly made without any taste except some sugar. The seats were comfortable. Since it was a holiday there was some rush and the service was just towards average side. Overall, my experience was Poor and total waste of time and money for selecting the Restaurant. Desserts were bigger disaster. The cake made by the chefs was a big NO.","August 22, 2016"
"We spent three nights with family at this hotel and found it greatly relaxing. Very courteous staff and the hotel has great amenities including a swimming pool that we used with the two little kids. Room was quite comfortable. We used the restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and found them to be absolutely mind blowing. Including the thin crust pizza and sumptuous desserts.","August 21, 2016"

A special mention of the friendly staff at the restaurant, extremely pleasant and great hospitality. I enjoyed the waffles there, it was mind-blowing.","August 20, 2016"
"Stark improvement in service since Crowne Plaza too over. Rooms a comfortable and clean. Front desk does not seems to be properly trained - any interaction is too time consuming. Additionally do not rely on front desk for any help, they are time wasters, speak directly to the individual who will service you!","August 19, 2016"
"Our overall experience was bad but the only good thing is the property which is quite new, the rooms are good.The gentlemen at reception are not meant for this job as they were not at all polite but the ladies are just the opposite..The location is bit far from the city so better to take a hotel in CP if you are in delhi as a tourist..The breakfast was not bad cant be compared to Le Meridian or Shangri La.I hope that the management will request the guys at reception to be more polite to customers as service matters the most in hospitality industry. ","August 18, 2016"
What a lovely hotel! The staff are super friendly but not in your face. The rooms are very nice. The gym is great with a nice sized pool. It gets the sun from about 1030 onwards. The food is fabulous and the pastry chef gave me his recipe for chocolate cake!! As a single female traveller I would totally recommend. ,"August 10, 2016"
"This was 10th stay in the hotel but as always it was comfortable. Though there was a problem in my room with TV, it has been fixed with hotel staff soon after I informed the problem.

Will see him shortly.","August 8, 2016"

"I have been staying in this hotel for the past two weeks as part of a business trip. I am going to check out in a few minutes but feel obligated to write a review about my stay here owing to the excellent service I received.The property is decent (not expansive) and houses pretty much all amenities one would expect from a luxury hotel. However, what sets this hotel apart is the service and enthusiasm of the staff. They don't mind walking an extra mile to make you feel at home. Special mention of Sunil (house keeping), Abhishek, Narendra and Hoshiyar (dining) and Bhagwan Das (Fitness center) who were exceptional.Some areas of improvement are vegetarian food at the dinner buffet (limited variety and oftentimes a bit greasy) and slow moving elevators.All in all you guys are doing a great job. Keep it up.","July 29, 2016"

"This was my 2nd trip to India for business. I previously stayed at another hotel in Nodia and this time my hosts placed me at the Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar. I have never had such a perfect stay. The entire facility was a tremendous clean and friendly place. I also have to mention 2 people that made my stay PERFECT - Ãvìnãsh Sìñgh and Narendra Singh. Avinash works at the front counter and was the friendliest, most professional hotel employee I have ever seen. He was so helpful and his involvement in my stay made it perfect. Narendra is the assistant Manager of Infinity, possibly the best reseeaurant in New Dellhi. He, along with the smiling faces of his staff made every meal perfect to start a day. He also greeted me like a friend and that made me feel at home. HIs staff, including Avinash Tiwari, made my stay like home; providing the best room serveice I have ever had. A perfect place that made me feel at home. I will definitely be back, soon!","July 25, 2016"

Please do thank the following people from my side-1) Chef Amit , Chef Mayaram, Chef Ashish, Chef Tarun who prepared home style food for me - Garwahli Dal, Dalhia Upma, - they are unbelievable . Chef Shakthi is incomparable. He has a personal connect with all guests which makes his so great.3) Chef Devas for coming and meeting me in person . His humility is worth emulating ! 4) Amit, Deepak, Shama at the Dury managers desk are always willing to help me.5) Arshad , Ajith and Avinash( he is a new boy - I hope I got his name right !) at the Bell desk. They are always concerned about your comfort.6) Doorman Dhirendra - he is indefatigable . His can be a thankless job but he works tirelessly like a well oiled engine .7) Narendra, Vinod, UttamPlease do thank all of these people. There are a few more whose name I am forgetting . I'll be honest . I do keep notes of all the staff members who touch me with their great work- but I misplaced my diary so I would have missed a few names!

I pampered myself by using steam and sauna during my stay and also took a massage. Which made me feel relaxed. They put up a lavish breakfast everyday, they also make something for you on request which makes you feel like home. The restaurant and reception staff is so warm and welcoming...very friendly and ready to help.. It was a great stay and a memorable one because of the service i got.","June 20, 2016"
I stayed for 5 nights with my wife and found the service excellent. The restaurant catered for my wife's gluten free needs with minimal fuss and the staff could not have been more helpful.

Check-in was very easy and the staff were very helpful. I was met in the lobby by executive Chef Diwas Wadhera and sous Chef Shakti Kumar who discussed my gluten free needs for my dining.

"It's a really comfortable place, where you can relax and not to worry about anything. Everybody takes such a good care of you... :) food is great, service is excellent - with all these real nice but not too pushy people. I stayed there for a whole month and couldn't complain once. All perfect.The only thing you need to remember about is that the place is far from being central, though it's quieter thanks to that. And for me it was not a problem as it was really close to my office, so all good :)","June 6, 2016"
"Stayed at the hotel on a Business Trip for 3 nights. Pleasant staff, excellent lobby and very warm service. The evening buffet is quite expansive but found it to be a bit overpriced. Would love to return.","June 3, 2016"

This hotel is just 2 kms from akshardham and 2 min. Walk to Ashok nagar metro station. So practically we can reach most parts of Delhi within 1 hour. Rooms are spacious and very well done. Gymnasium and swimming pool are open 24 hours to help international travellers. Breakfast spread is elaborate. Although taste of Indian could have been better. Overall it is value for money.,"May 25, 2016"
"Thanks and I really enjoyed my one day stay at your Hotel.The staff were very friendly but professional at the same time.My requests were addressed very quickly indeed.The room was very comfortable in deed, and even with the Metro near by, the noise levels were well controlled. The large windows allows a lot of sunlight, but can be controlled with the types of curtains provided when need.A small suggestion- that the sofa in room be changed as it is too soft and feels broken. Perhaps it could be replaced with a newer but firmer sofa that is comfortable and does not cause back aches.In room Dinning - Special effort was made by the room service dinning in charge in ensuring I was provided pure vegetarian meals of my choice. This was much appreciated as I had returned from a 20day Kumbh Mela spiritual trip from Ujjain and needed to follow a strict vegetarian diet.The SPA was excellent. I was cared for well by the Masseurs from Nagaland.The desk manager was also very helpful in selecting/suggesting SPA treatments for me.Breakfast was incredible. yum and fresh. Lots of continental and non-continental choices.Keep up the excellent service.","May 25, 2016"
"The location is near Noida, Mayur Vihar and not far from central Delhi. The hotel looks decent, the lobby is not very great but okay. The rooms look good , the sofa in the room needs urgent refurinshing as foam has sagged. The view from room is terrible looking into drain .The bathroom does not have a faucet , wonder whom they are catering too. The restaurant looks nice but buffet breakfast was tasteless , in fact no item was alright.","May 21, 2016"
"Probably not the best location unless you have work nearby. It is in close proximity to Akshardhama and also good access to Ghaziabad, Noida from here.We checked in on a Sunday afternoon and took about 7-8 minutes to get our rooms allocated. The rooms were well laid out and spacious. Had a couch apart from the large plus double bed. Bed was a bit too soft if you ask me, the mattress topper was thick and very soft.Bathroom had a tub apart from the shower area and it was well equipped with toiletries, dental kit etc. Faucet was missing as is sadly the case with most hotels these days.The room had a mini bar and tea maker too. No complaints from the room per se. The service also was good, staff were courteous and smiling. The buffet spread for breakfast was quite varied, they had fruits, juices, bakery products which were fresh and good, but the rest of the breakfast was very poor. Idlis were hard, sambhar was tasteless, uthappam was bland, poha was dry and everything else also was off the mark.Quite disappointing as the breakfast was our last interaction with the hotel while checking out and it was a big let down.Need to bring in better chefs, otherwise a good hotel to stay in.","May 19, 2016"
"Overall, this is a nice hotel. The bed was very comfortable and the room and premises were very clean. A great lounge and bar. The breakfast was very, very good - in fact, exceptional. Service was superb.My wife and I had two concerns:1. The location is not great if you are a tourist. There really is nowhere to go within walking distance or even a short cab ride.2. Sitting on the outdoor patio, or sometimes even in the lounge, you occasionally can smell sewage. It is not pleasant. Our room did not smell, and the restaurant is on the opposite side of the building.As a result of these two concerns, I wish I could rate this 3-1/2. Unfortunately, that is not an option. It is otherwise better than average, but does not quite rate a 4.I also would note that, other than the excellent service, there is nothing particularly Indian about this hotel.","May 18, 2016"
I have stayed twice at this hotel and am greatly impressed with the level of service. I am particularly impressed with the restaurant staff. The rooms are modern and clean. Housekeeping is reliable and the desk is very helpful. I also feel safe. Great business hotel!,"May 17, 2016"
"This hotel was beautiful and modern, friendly staff and very clean, food was amazing, a bit far from the city centre but close to a metro station. The restaurant offered a buffet dinner and done a 2 for 1 deal on beer. The pool and spa area is lovely.","May 3, 2016"
Very nice stay and great service. People are really nice specially punit who is incharge of bar he is really helpful and humle.Front desk people also very nice had dinner at infinity restaurant which was really nice.,"May 2, 2016"
Visited this afternoon for a family lunch. Indulged in the buffet in a group of 12 people. They seemed extremely disinterested in serving and were clearly short staffed. No one seemed to be bothered refill the empty service containers and requests were not met with any promptness. To make matters worse the food was generally tasteless and not a single item warranted a second helping!These new generation 5 star hotels have the infrastructure but don't have soul! ,"May 1, 2016"

"Excellent, prompt service and exceptionally large rooms made our stay at Crowne Plaza in Mayur Vihar very comfortable. Conveniently located if you have work in Noida, the hotel is not far from the metro or DND flyover. It serves a wide spread for breakfast and the attentive service of the waitstaff add to the warm welcome.","April 24, 2016"

"This hotel is super excellent for wheelchair users. The whole staff is well trained to help the persons on wheelchair and they take care of you like their own family member. I was facing the big time problem since my arrival in Delhi from Canada to find a good accessible hotel, and my friends found this one. They discussed my situation with the Sales Manager and he assured them not to worry about me and they will take care of every help, I needed for. And on my arrival, I found that they have big accessible washroom as per international norms and they happily adjusted my bed size and about three times changed my mattress to my satisfaction. Staff and Managers with smiling face always helping me out to transfer from my bed to washroom chair and to my normal wheelchair. I am enjoying my trip, which is only possible to the Crown Plaza's courteous staff. I am going to share my whole trip in a blog after my this visit to Delhi. Thanks Crown Plaza.","April 18, 2016"
"I have been a regular since 2013. When This place was under different brand and the staff was fired the too. We have hosted out son's first birthday my brother's thank you party etc. I have seen this place going down in terms of the quality of staff (baring few) and they buffet's spreads has narrowed down too. Most of the time restaurant remains book bra it attracts good chunk of Noida and Delhi people because of this nice location. I would really want the management to look deeply into my concern about the decorating quality off buffet menu and the quality of the staff members. So that, I can happily edit my review","April 17, 2016"
"Stayed for 3 nights and my view points are as mentioned below - Pro's -- Very Courteous staff & excellent customer service- Clean and Hygenic rooms- Good Ambience- Room had all amenities including a safe, iron board, iron, coffee maker, Basic toiletories- Quick Check-in & Check-out- 24 x 7 Room Service- Multi-cusine breakfast spread- Quick response time- Great sleep qualityCons-- Food prices are way too high- Bathroom does not have a health faucet suitable to Indian customers- Location is far away from any other local restaurants- No View from the windowsOn the whole a good hotel to stay in. More affordable menu's would have made it a great hotel !!","April 12, 2016"
"I 100% enjoyed my stay at this hotel. I arrived 04:00am and was happy to see a very comfortable room with a high quality bed. I always look for a comfortable bed, clean, secure rooms with a good shower, and this room had them all. The breakfast was amazing, so much to choose from, and the Western and Indian foods were delicious.The hotel was around 1 hour from the airport (in the early morning time), and less than an hour to the city centre (around 30 to 40 minutes). The staff were also very helpful and friendly, they couldn't do enough for you. I would also like to make a point of the kind help from Mr Rahul Sharma, for organising a late checkout for me. Nothing was ever a problem. Will be staying at this hotel again for sure on my next visit to Ghaziabad. Many thanks to the Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar Noida team.","April 11, 2016"
"Great Hotel, near Metro between Delhi & Noida which makes it a great location for tourist spots & business. Near by there's not much to see. Room big & comfortable, great breakfast and restaurant. Service / Reception always available to help you with anything. Everything was perfect but few little things could be improved in future to make it Awesome:- If I for example put on my doors ""Do not Disturb"" it means I don't want to be disturbed (especially I did it for weekends or when not feeling well) - and then few people been calling me or knocking on my doors from stuff if I wish to clean my room.- During last weekend of my stay they decided to wash all pillows near pool which was not comfi to stay. I think they could schedule washing during working day when less people go to enjoy sun & pool- in 85% every time I asked for coffee they always bring it without spoon - I think should be automatic to serve....just a little things for future :) Will definitely stay again and recommend to everyone!","April 7, 2016"
I stayed in the Crowne Plaza for a week. I am usually hard-to-please when it comes to customer satisfaction butI am very impressed with CP and have absolutely no complaints. Things which are I really liked are. - Super simple WiFi access -- it just works - after the first time login - no repeated web authentication. And its fast as well. - Attention to detail -- In so many little things - very impressed. - The Room service and house cleaning staff are extremely courteous and nice- Food is GOOD ( P.S. - I only had the morning breakfast),"April 7, 2016"
"The Hotel is very conveniently located for visitors for Noida .Though the property is not a very large one, it is one of the best business hotel I have ever stayed in terms of facilities and hospitality, which is one of the best I have experienced. The room decor is elegant with matching toilet.","April 5, 2016"
"By Delhi and Noida standards, there isn't a nicer hotel. I'm currently several days into a two week stay at this hotel. As is true with much of India, the surrounding areas may seem a little unclean or unsafe to people who haven't visited India, but the Crowne Plaza is like entering a haven. They've done an excellent job of creating a hotel that exceeds the sometimes too-high standards that we American travelers may have when we visit other Countries. My room and every facility I've visited within the hotel have been clean and in excellent repair. The hotel and property maintain a very high level of guest security, and it is very easy to relax once you're at the hotel, even if you are (like me) new to India and still a bit unsure of the surroundings. The rooms are beautiful and extraordinarily well appointed.What sets this place apart is that every employee with whom I've interacted has treated me as if I am royalty, when in truth, I am just a business traveler who is new to the area and still anxious of the unfamiliar. A word about housekeeping...if you are lucky enough to be able to make a selection when you arrive, you should try to stay in a room that is maintained by ""Sunil. "" I am fortunate this week and next in that I'm in one of his rooms (room 810), and he treats both me and the room as if he owned the property and as if I were a guest in his house. He takes a sense of pride and diligence in his work that I frankly would do well to adopt in my own profession. Obviously, Sunil made sure that my room was clean and well stocked when I've arrived, but beyond that, he has offered and made good on his offers to meet my every need and desire. He asked if my bed and pillows were too firm or too soft, and offered to exchange them if I did not find them to be perfect. On the first day of my visit I asked for extra bottled water and sugar for my coffee. Every day since then, when I arrive in my room in the evening, Sunil has made sure that I have fresh bottles of water and extra packets of sugar, and plenty of both. Each day he services my room, he has also left something wonderful, unique, beautiful and special. So far, I've come in to find his famous ""towel art"" (photos located on this site). Last evening, there was a vase of the most beautiful, freshly cut yellow lillies I've ever seen.I work for a company that is large and international. In fact, we have almost 2,000 employees in Noida alone. We are frequent international travelers, and my traveling companion/coworker and I chose this hotel based on the recommendation of another coworker who visited a few months back. Likewise, we will recommend the Crown Plaza exclusively when we return to the U.S. in a few weeks.Thanks, Crowne Plaza and especially Sunil for making our trip special and for making me not so homesick while I am here.","April 4, 2016"
"We have had meals on 3 different ocassions at Infinity Restaurant, in Crowne Plaza, Mayur Vihar, New Delhi. The restaurant is located on left wing of ground floor adjacent to the hotel lobby. The place looks quite spacious as you enter. Food is spread all over the place and there is choice from a large variety of different items. Normally you would get a blend of both Indian & continental cuisine, Cut fruits, bakery items, Indian sweets, starters, beverages, breads/Rotis, Ice cream etc. offers good choice for the diner. Staff would serve you refills when ever required, hence you may not get up to seek food. Taste is good for most items. Beware if you are taking two meals i.e. both Lunch & Dinner on any day expect many dishes to repeat. Positive side is that if you miss something at Lunch, you may get it in Dinner again. One side of Infinity Restaurant is quite bright because it is close to open space, however you would hear noise of Delhi Metro. Infinity Restaurant also has a bar which offers wide variety of liquor. Bar side of Infinity Restaurant is quieter. Staff are energetic, would serve quickly and with a smile. A decent place to take your business guests if you are in Noida or this part of Delhi i.e. Mayur Vihar, Akshar Dham etc.","April 1, 2016"
"Best hotel i stayed at in India. Everything was perfect - from the lobby to the rooms, restaurant and amenities - they all looked great! I was even contacted by one of their staff via email that i left my phone charger before i could send them an email to look for it.","March 27, 2016"
I stayed here for a week and loved the size and quality of the room. Room service was excellent and all in all I think this is a really good option if you are visiting Delhi or Noida.What let the hotel down were the reception staff and the people serving at the restaurant. I found the whole experience soured as a result of this. ,"March 27, 2016"
"Place and food was vibrant, live music and warm food on the table was mesmerising We have been asked twice and thrice everytime for any dish they were serving.We like fresh cakes and pastries with laal maans ","March 20, 2016"
I have no opinion on location or pool/wellness area since you I did not use it during three days at the hotel. However the room was very nice and modern - good for work with a real desk and good WiFi. The only restsurant had a good buffet which apparently was included in my charge which was a pleasant suprise!,"March 18, 2016"
"This is the worst hotel I have stayed in ever.It lied about its services and essentially cheats customers on all service delivery.I feel I have been robbed.There is no Executive Floor nor privileges which I booked and paid for online. Until I questioned the problem only then did breakfast, cocktails and newspaper were given incrementally after each question. They also kept referring to the room type which got even more frustrating.I think the brand has a major problem on their hands with a business partner that is essentially putting the Crowne Plaza name through mud with this property.Indifference from senior management leaving front line staff helpless and disempowered.I have not seen such a poorly run, kept and demoralised hotel. It brings me back to 1993 days to the beginnings of international hospitality standards in Delhi.I'm writing this on my last night at the hotel. Everyday was tainted with frustration stay for 3 nights. For 1/2 amount of money stay next door at the Holiday Inn. The Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar is un-ratable.","March 14, 2016"
"Hotel standards vary from the states. This hotel would be rated 3 stars in the states, but it's rated 5 stars in India. I stayed at two hotels in Noida. This one is way better than Park Plaza in terms of food, amenities, and customer service.However, this hotel lacks some key basics:1) No good food between 3-7pm. Americans typically eat between 5-7pm. Their dinner buffet doesn't start until 7pm. That's too late considering I was sleeping at 6pm. Their menu deceives as it looks like they have alot of options. In reality, they have 5 entrees and 2 appetizers. I have never experienced this at other hotels in the world.2) The beds are so uncomfortable. I sink about 6 inches into my bed. I prefer a firm bed that supports my back.3) Staff are hit and miss. Front desk say they are eager to help, but their actions are contradictory. We tried to ask to have some food gifts to be wrapped, so they wouldn't leak or spill in my suitcase. After a 10 min argument, they finally concede and wrap it in saran wrap. Was it that hard? It wasn't a language barrier because my Indian friend was speaking their language. They just didn't want to help because it was outside of their norm.4) Their business centre is a misnomer. It's a dark room with one computer and one printer that you cannot freely use. You need to ask for permission and it requires a different pin code to gain internet access. How backwards!5) Hotel staff removed some drinks/food from the fridge towards the end of my stay and tried to charge me for it. I noticed this as I was using the fridge for my own personal drinks and food. Either the staff got hungry, or they tried to sneak charges into tourist's invoice.If you lower your hotel standards to India or U.S Holiday Inn standards, then I would recommend this hotel. I stayed here for 2 weeks.","March 6, 2016"
"Vey good & consistent in terms what you'd expect from CP. Big rooms & bathroom, well appointed and comfortable bed. Good service throughout, ordered room service due to our late arrival which was delivered promptly. Location is ideal for Noida or doing the trek to Agra / Taj Mahal (which we did)Breakfast and other meals all very good quality and value. Overall pleased and delivered on what we would expect. ","March 4, 2016"
"I am travelling India almost every month and try a lot of hotels across India, and found out that the hospitality extended to me by hotel staff is always very nice and I could stay comfortably. Also hotel service is upto the level. A few thing I have to say. The location of the hotel is good for me as I am business traveller and my business destination is quite near from the hotel, and therefore it is convenient for me but I am not sure if it is good for sightseeing. Maybe good for the tour to Agra, Taj Mahal, because the hotel is located at something like gateway to Taj Mahal. Anyway, I will visit this Crowne Plaza again shortly and look forward to seeing everyone at the hotel.","March 2, 2016"
"Stayed here 3 nights . Pickup at the airport was quick , guest officer gave a nice welcome , driver was good n alert to road traffic . Welcome at the hotel was normal . Room was spacious n clean . I noticed a subtle relaxing aroma on the bed sheets and nice smell on towels - something not experienced in other IHG hotels before - for which I give the 5th star . Staff at restaurants polite n food is good . ","February 27, 2016"
"Regular visitor and mostly stay at this place as it is convenient for office travel. Was disappointed this time due to few irritants.1) Hotel was running full due to various groups, and had reservations for part of the stay available.2) Specifically asked for a non-smoking room when I came in the morning and kept the luggage - was told rooms were not ready and would be available in the afternoon. Upon returning in the evening from office, I had to go thru the entire check in process, and then was given a room - only to discover it was stinking of smoke. Called up reception and they did some checking for 40 min and called back to tell me that there were no rooms available. Workaround was to have the room sprayed with a room spray. 3) Room was not the standard executive room I normally stayed in.4) Was not recognized as a frequent stayer and Platinum card member, did not get the welcome fruits or drinks that I normally get at these places.5) Was not asked for newspaper choice and did not get it on first day.all this shows a bit of unprofessional check in experience and taking care of frequent stayers.Fortunately the dining experience was good all through, always love the food spread available and the people in the dining area are always courteous and caring. Hoping the next stay will work out better and a bit less impersonal !","February 19, 2016"
The property is well located close to a metro station and particularly convenient for visiting Akshardham. A trip to the airport in traffic hours can be a pain though. The hotel is modern and has a nice ambiance. the rooms are well supplied and comfortable. The real strength is the team. Excellent !!!,"February 17, 2016"

"Were hesitant when coming to India and decided to book more than three star hotels - we were not disappointed! The Crowne Plaza hotel room was like an oasis after a big day out sightseeing! The beds were to die for - you just slipped into the soft and comfty bed and had the best nights sleep. Though the hotel is out of the way - we didn't find that a problem only a few stops on the train to the centre or 20 minutes in a tuk, tuk which we did. If you are sick of the hotel food and want something nice and close by go out the back of the hotel to the Galleria Mall which is mostly full of liquor shops but there is one restaurant called Great Plates which we ate at twice and it was delicious and they sold the best growler of beer made here in Delhi. Crowne Plaza we would definitely stay again if in the area. I must say the staff were very helpful and so so friendly. The buffet breaky was the best we had on the trip, delicious and many, many choices!","February 14, 2016"
The rooms are well appointed and have all the facilities required! Staff was quite courteous and very helpful. The Breakfast was great with a good team to attend to your requests.The hotel is worth the price! the only feed back is that the food pricing is too steep and can be worked a bit lower which i am sure will ensure a better revenue,"February 8, 2016"
"The hotel is very pleasant to stay in with very helpful staff. Our room was clean and comfortable with plenty of space with an adjoining section with a desk and sofa. The bathroom was large, great shower and even nicer large bath. There is a remote control to close the blind covering the glass wall of the bathroom. All usual amenities are provided such as hair dryer, tea and coffee sachets etc. there is free wifi in the lobby area but you have to pay to have it in your room unless you are an IHG hotel club member. The hotel location is remote tho there is a train station nearby but you are restricted in where to eat anywhere near unless you get transport. The food is great and the bar snacks tasty!","February 2, 2016"
"While not staying at the Crowne Plaze we can here for the food. Sanjay and Narendra looked after us for breakfasts, lunches and dinners. The food was fantastic along with the service. All tastes are catered for, local or international. Highly recommend it.The only issue is the location as it's not close to shops or entertainment but does have a metro station within 5 minutes walking distance.","January 31, 2016"
"The room I stayed was very good, Nice sofa, study table with good lighting and seating, comfy Bed .Buffet breakfast is too good, I was spolied with their choice.

"This hotel was extremely comfortable modern rooms. All the staff were very helpful. I would have given 5 stars but the location is in an isolated area and free wi fi was only available in the lobby.The dining experience for breakfast, lunch and dinner was the best we had travelling around India. There was such a great variety of western and Indian food. I would particular commend Narendra Singh for his attention to detail and assistance at breakfast. At dinner Sunjay looked after us and was always smiling and friendly. There is also a lovely lobby bar.","January 21, 2016"
"Really enjoyed our stay, beautiful hotel. Staff very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping perfect. I really enjoyed breakfasts in the hotel.

"Located near Akshar Dham are 2 similar hotels in size and frontage and built side by side. The first one is Crowne Plaza and just off the busy expressway of Noida-Mayur Vihar, adjoining the Metro Track, it overlooks the Jamuna River from a distance. The scenery is marred by haphazard constructions in nearby ar as, and from my 12th Floor room I could see some ugly structures surrounding the area. But vast open fields where vegetables were being cultivated, large open parcels of land nearby gives a rustic look which is not unappealing.The staff are very courteous and efficient. The room sizes are spacious and well planned. The sofa seating is adequate for seating two persons comfortably and still leave enough space for the writing table to be used without cramping. Good bathroom size. Good clean construction.","December 27, 2015"
"Best hotel to stay for your business trip,tasty food,officers are so kind.you will love all the facilities they have.Room cleaning is perfect, gym, sauna, steam bath.Good view to the mall and the metro station as well , location is good also, you can access most of delhi places in short time.","December 21, 2015"

Just one tip, don't for straight whiskey, the amount you get it's ridiculous.The staff is super helpful and the decor of the whole building it is beautiful. Free internet and no need for light adapters ","November 30, 2015"
The hotel has improved by leaps and bounds since my last visit about one and a half years back. The quality of the breakfast was good and wholesome. The staff courteous and helpful. Service was fast and great. The rooms as usual were quite good.Likely to stay again when in the same area.,"November 30, 2015"
"Read the bad reviews: there is a sewage treatment plant right outside. The 11th floor also smells horribly of cigarette smoke. And they are working on the 13th floor so higher floors will hear the banging.The staff are very kind and thoughtful, and the beds are comfortable. The rooms and bathrooms are good. We slept well. And it is a short walk to a Metro station. Soak a tissue in perfume to hold up to your nose as you walk. The noise of the trains is not a problem.The Delhi Metro system is the best way to get around. Crowded but not scary. Ridiculously cheap. Easy to navigate. Good air conditioning.Back to the hotel: it still does not have a working pool. Another reviewer said it was under renovation in February. That was nine months ago and it is still closed. Wi-fi is only available free in the lobby and every time you want to connect you have to get a code from the staff. This is crazy!This hotel is in Noida, not Delhi. It was booked for us by a travel agent. Find somewhere else.","November 20, 2015"
"I spent 3 weeks in this hotel due to my business trip. I can highly recommend this place even for such long stay. The room was big and very comfortable, the food was very good, but the best were people who work there and take care of all your needs. They make you feel like you are princess, they fulfill your wishes before you even start to say them. People who provide a great service there make that atmosphere in Crowne Plaza is so special. You have that feeling that every ordinary day turns into a great holiday. In here I would like to thank a lot to NARENDRA MODI – the waiter who has such big passion in everything what he does, friendly as nobody else, smiley every time, helpful and natural. He has lots of positive energy. He always makes your day during your breakfasts. Thank you so much! It was great to have such waiter during 3-week stay in this hotel! I hope you will be promoted soon.","November 9, 2015"

"From the outside this hotel looks a little dated but inside the decor is magnificent, the rooms were excellent and I got a very warm welcome from the staff and they made me feel very welcome during my stay. I really enjoyed the restaurant buffet, it had a wide range of items, great quality of local and international dishes and quite reasonably priced.","November 9, 2015"
"Both Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn @ Mayur Vihar appears to be the properties of the same owner. The quality service is clearly differentiated. I had booked at Holiday Inn for a couple of days and 1 N at Crowne Plaza for the experience. Being a IHG Platinum Ambassador, the treatment at the 2 properties was quite a gap. The room ambience, interior décor and personnel hospitality at Crowne Plaza are notches up. Bar was well-stocked and breakfast spread greater choices than next door. Crowne Plaza does pamper its guests. Rates was not much higher at Crowne Plaza. I will choose this hotel the next time I am in Noida. The only setback is the stench from the river in front of the location.","November 8, 2015"
"I stayed 5 nights in October 2015 on a business trip. Staff and service exceptionally good. Hotel itself: room and in-room facilities very good,superb bed, excellent gym. Restaurant is good although not particularly exciting. Bar was very quiet mid-week - not much atmosphere.","November 5, 2015"

"I've stayed in quite a few hotels all over India and this one didn't disappoint. Clean and modern with all facilities you would want and very friendly staff. House keeping made a different towel animal each day which made the return every night fun, wondering what Sunil would make next, they were all a work of art! The food was good, room service provided in room dining, the stuffed mushrooms must be tried. Breakfast catered for all tastes and the evening meals were made especially hot as per my request. The restaurant staff couldn't do enough for me and made me feel so welcome, thanks to Ratan and the team. As you can see in the photo, they really were a nice bunch. The only negative is the pool was being renovated but that wasn't a problem because it was a business trip and I didn't have time anyway. If I ever visit this area again I will be sure to stay here. By the way, the bad smell that people mention is a local sewage works, it didn't put me off because it's not the sort of area that you are out and about around the hotel, I didn't smell anything bad within the hotel. Keep up the good work! Mr Chilli.","October 26, 2015"

Has a compliment of well trained staff that is standing by to take care of the guests.The smiling faces and the folded hands right at the gates make one feel welcome.Right from my first stay in July 2015, i have found the breakfast at the at the lobby level restaurant is a delightful experience . excellent spread of great food enhances your appetite and well mannered staff actually care for you. The high ceilings, excellent lighting and comfortable seating arrangement have resulted in creating an excellent ambiance. Breakfast time here is an enjoyable time and in fact an excellent beginning to the day ahead for business travelers like me. Some of the staff are easy conversationalists who cold provide information that is needed to the tourists.quick checking in as one checks in after a long and tedious journey is a big relief and as i was ushered in to my room the freshness and absence of musty smell began relaxing me. the service staff and the other hotel personnel are non obtrusive and do not unnecessarily bother you or excessively greet you.

While one morning there was delay in serving tea and i was late for my meeting, they provided me a take away cup. During early check out they provided me with a packed breakfast.The room was really big and bathroom is spacious too. The tatasky set top box was adequately loaded. The seating area inside the room is well thought of and one can travel with young family and can get some leisure time. Well, wiifi is not complimentary unless you take membership which i took but you will expect it to be complimentary in a hotel like this.

The staff is really good and ensures that your stay is comfortable.Food is good too, the rooms are spacious and offer a beautiful views of Delhi in the night and early morning!It is a place to stay if your work is around Noida or South DelhiHighly Recommended!","August 29, 2015"
Excellent room and excellent service.One of the best!Rooms have a lovely view of the city. I like the Crowne Plaza and have stayed in other Crowne Plazas as well. Reception and housekeeping staff were very courteous.,"August 28, 2015"
"I have been member of the Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar Noida ,and whenever I travelled to Delhi I always stay in this hotel. Their King Size Beds are nice and comfortable. Would recommend this hotel to everyone, who is looking for a luxury stay in Delhi. Rooms especially on higher floors have better views of City. You can see Akshardham temple and some tall buildings of Central Delhi also visible from your room. It has a beautiful view of Yamuna River (pool facing only), which gives a fresh feeling when you wake up in the morning. Nice breakfast with a huge variety of Indian and continental food. It made being away from home a little bit easier. Rooms are very clean and seems newly built. Staff in Reservations, Lobby and Housekeeping were very polite and they always ready to help you out to make your stay WOW in the hotel. Looking forward to stay again and enjoy the hospitality of Crowne Plaza, Mayur Vihar.","August 24, 2015"
"Beautiful, clean and comfortable hotel, with excellent Indian and international choices in its restaurant. Professional staff at reception assisted in solving any issue encountered. Wifi connection available everywhere for free not so common in Indian accommodation. Great!","August 22, 2015"

"Unfortunately this is my 3rd business trip in this hotel, and apart from the forever apologetic staff to cover up the goof ups, the experience has been worse every time.1st visit: I was given a room wherein the above floor had some construction going on.inspite of some 30 phone calls in 24 hrs the work was not stopped. I even wrote to the corporate sales director but he surely matches the 'shamelessness' scale adapted well by this hotel staff.2nd visit: dirty sofa with stains all over, shower not working properly,dirty bedsheets, used showercap wrapped in pouch, night lamp not working and ofcourse the unmatched performance by the always apologetic staff3rd visit: room given in dark corner of the alley, work still happening on the floor above, dirty sofa, and yes! inspite of stating each time in my trip to give me hard pillows, the hotel staff refuses to learn and personalize the experience.Overall! Wont be repeating visit to this pathetic hotel again. ","August 17, 2015"
couldn't find a fault....right from the greetings from security personnel to friendly reception staff ...very warm hospitality. And rooms have been furnished with good taste ....rain water shower. Comfortable bed and view. Dinner and breakfast had good spread. Metro station near by if you want to cut short travel time. Don't forget to dial guest services...girls there speak with nice international English accent :-) sounds cute.,"August 14, 2015"

"I booked a stay at Crowne Plaza Noida for a family visit to the Mayur Vihar area and was pleasantly surprised by the warm welcome: a nice Indian shawl and a gift hamper presented while checking in. Turns out that I was the first Spire Elite member to visit the hotel after the change in IHG’s loyalty program. I was also told that the breakfast buffet was included with the room booking, which is a big plus. The staff at the banquet and front desk were instructed of my “Spire Elite” status and were extra attentive to the needs of my family. Our room on the 10th floor had a full-length glass window with a scenic view of East Delhi, Yamuna and beyond. The hotel is located in a prime area between Mayur Vihar and Noida in East Delhi area, close to the Metro station. The reception lobby and banquet area have a fresh and inviting feel. Rooms are well equipped with amenities that one can expect at any Crowne Plaza. With all the positives, there is only one minus? As of July 2015, the property is undergoing renovation; however most of the facilities (except the swimming pool) continue to be available to guests. (note: Although the stay was using my IHG® Rewards Club points, I was treated to a “five-star” Spire Elite experience)","July 25, 2015"
"My friends and I recently stayed for a week at this fantastic hotel! The staff were so friendly and helpful and made us feel that nothing was too much trouble! From delivering a wine opener in less than 2 minutes (thank you!!!) to fixing the TV remote control that actually wasn't broken (I blame the person who delivered the wine opener! Ahem!) to the wonderful waiters - Sunil and Narendra for delivering the most delicious Indian breakfasts and hot masala chai! BUT..the most awesome part was when I asked the manager if he could recommend a crash course Indian cooking lesson somewhere in town...He offered a lesson from the Head Chef, Diwas Wadhera. WOW!!! He showed us how to make Palak Paneer, Veg Jalfrezi and his special dish of Crispy Spinach with Marinated Paneer on a Tomato Curry Sauce and finally Chapati! And then we got to eat this delicious creation. He gave us so much time and was so patient with all of my questions and he's going to send a video to help me remember what he taught us! Thank you Chef Wadhera! So, all in all a great experience! The rooms were clean, modern and spacious and I would definitely stay here again!","July 20, 2015"
I went there for a corporate dinner party and I was the person who arranged it. I queried many hotels out of which this hotel gave me the best deal for Infinity restaurant. The first impression was very bad and the rest followed it. Here are some pointers out of my review for this hotel:1. Unplanned hotel staff2. Pathetic food taste3. Hard like rock starters4. AC did not work for 3 hours Many more.Not recommended. Avoid the food.,"July 17, 2015"
"Loved the room . One of the finest room I have stayed in .Well appointed well planed and delightful lovely view from the room. Very near to metro station and well located if you have work both in Noida as well as in Delhi, Food is really good. Staff very polite and try to be helpful. will go extra mile. Great looking lift.Now the Cons. Its situated near a smelly canal so it offends while one goes in and out of Hotel. Service is not good in spite politeness of staff. You will keep waiting if you are not having buffet. So will advice you to let the manager know that you are not having buffet. Lift is a let down due to huge temperature difference . Somehow lift itself has been excluded from the Air conditioner system. Swimming pool was non functional while I was there. Only one restaurant. One can stay here just for room","July 14, 2015"
"Good hotel, exceptionally well service.It is well maintained property with a sleek atmosphere. Value for money.The rooms are plush, with every possible amenity in there and if there is something missing, they are happy to provide it for you that very instant.The hotel is well connected with local transport and Delhi metro.The breakfast is served on time with good service.The hotel serves good food in their restaurants, the bar serves a wide menu but at steep cost.If you are traveling to Delhi, this is a good place to stay and feel comfortable.","July 11, 2015"
"Stayed here for 2 nights. I hadn't picked the hotel myself, but had somewhat higher expectations considering its a Crowne Plaza. I arrived at night and when we pulled up to the hotel I noticed an extremely bad stench coming from outside. I almost had to throw up. Looking out of my window the next morning i knew why. The building is located right next to a polluted river and a sewage treatment plant!! The smell is everywhere and it made my stay rather unpleasant, which is sad, cause it is actually quite a good hotel. Staff is very friendly (almost a bit too caring though). The rooms are comfortable. Good size, all amenities. WiFi (free for Starwood members otherwise charged), shower, bath tub, safety deposit box, iron/ironing board, etc.Buffet breakfast is ok. Nothing special and almost a bit disappointing for a Crowne Plaza with limited choice.Location of the hotel is seemingly in the middle of nowhere with nothing around it. There is a Metro station within walking distance though.","July 8, 2015"
I was late to go to Delhi and used my miles to book a room for my family and my self at short notice .. Hotel not only adjusted us at short notice but also took care of us .. we had a very nice memorable stay during our stay in India .. i got a well deserved rest and break fast was superb..hotel was clean and staff was well trained and up to the mark .. This hotel is just outskids of delhi .. with in 20 min and near a well renowned temple so in morning we went to temple too .. this was best part of my India trip .. well done .. raman sharma i was in the hotel on 22 june,"July 1, 2015"
"Recently I had an opportunity to stay at Crowne Plaza. The stay was for a brief period of 3 nights [2230hrs-15-06-2015 to 0430 hrs-18-06-2015. The first impression got at the reception was very welcome. My room was on the 11th Floor. Since it was already late I had my dinner while my luggage was transferred by the hotel staff into my room.The spread of food variety quite good and I must say I did enjoy my dinner. The room which I entered later was very spic and span. Now, the quality of presentation is surely expected from a 5-star hotel of this sort. The hotel room has a transparent glass as separation from the bath. This wasn’t the first time I was into such a hotel. In my last experience at a hotel in Navi Mumbai of such a construction, I had exclaimed, ”Ah! The right place for a honeymoon couple.” It had taken me some time to discover the pull-down screen for privacy of shower or clearing the bowels. The added attraction here was automation of the process of drawing down the screen! Yes, there was a remote to be used for this – and there were two sets of it- One near the bathtub and the other at the head of the well-made immaculately clean double bed. That was very thoughtful on the part of the interior designer.Another feature that was attractive to me was the provision of a shower n addition to the bathtub. Any environmentally conscious person would opt for using the shower instead of the bath. Though, an occasional bath in the tub would be quite refreshing. The table inside was well stocked with the necessities of an intrepid and unprepared traveller. The next thing to surprise me was the contents of the wardrobe. I was worried how would I get my dresses pressed for the laundry rates of a 5-star would be a fleecing. I was again pleasantly surprized to find an automatic iron and an ironing table very neatly placed inside the wardrobe. Wow! That was the best thing I found here as against the other hotel in Mumbai. This is one thing I wish every hotel did. This is by far the most important utility item that a hotel could stock. The key-card, the stationery, and the packaged coffee-maker albeit, with a very frugal set of dairy-creamer sachets were all there very aesthetically and ergonomically laid out, in a draw-out arrangement- ingenuity again!The ubiquitous well-stocked mini bar, a standard in these hotels was there. The auto-on wall-TV with default display announcing proudly all the in-room specialties of the hotel was there to inform. What was missing then? Yeah, there is and I did leave a feedback suggestion for the same to be incorporated: A self-winding clothes line to dry inner-wear, should the stay be sufficiently longer on a light packed travel luggage, would add to the utilitarian thoughtfulness.Now, let’s come to the food spread. In this department I found the hotel wanting – not in all cuisines, but the South Indian varieties especially. The Idli-sambar wasn’t mouth- watering. The masala dosa was a cropper. The North Indian and Continental breakfast was good. This of course was in line with my experience of 5-star cuisine in general. Perhaps gourmets are not the kind of people who choose an ambience of this sort.Last but not the least – would I want to stay here on my next visit? Certainly. Would I recommend this place to anyone of my colleagues or compatriots? A double yes! But I would seek some other place for the pleasures of the palate! MAHADEVA S. SARMA","June 22, 2015"

"The stay at this hotel was comfortable although hit by a few eventualities.....Decided to spend a Saturday night at this hotel. Although i had done my booking online, the same was not featuring on the system when i checked in, had to wait for around 20 - 25 minutes to get the same processed. The front office staff needs to be educated about the hotel facilities as they are not aware of the same.....and this is really important as front office guys are the first point of impression for any hotel. The same was sough ted after some time.The rooms are big and comfortable and the room service is good. The spa is also pretty good.The hotel is good for a short business trip but not for a long visit.","June 11, 2015"

This was a great hotel to start our stay in India. It is safe to walk in this neighborhood and restaurants and shopping are in walking distance. The room was very comfortable with a view of a local soccer field. The curtains work with a remote. The room is nice with a desk and big work area. The wifi signal is strong.

"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for 3 weeks while working in Noida. The hotel is modern and the suite I stayed in on the 12th Floor was extremely comfortable and stylish. The hotel has all the amenities you would expect although there is very little in the surrounding area. The hotel restaurant provides a buffet or you can choose a la carte. The buffet provides plenty of variety of food and I particularly enjoyed the curries which come with all the extras including garlic naan bread fresh from the oven and tandoori. Breakfast was always enjoyable particularly the masala chai. Service at the hotel was of a particularly high standard. I would particularly commend the front desk manager Nainci, Sanjay and Vikas who worked in the restaurant and the chef Deep. Nothing was ever too much trouble and the staff overall made every effort to ensure my stay was as enjoyable as possible. If I return to Noida on business in the future, I will certainly stay at the Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar again.","May 20, 2015"
"Well, I got a confirmation call for my pre-booked room and was received at the reception desk. As the hotel was fully booked my request for giving a room on pool facing side was entertained by the receptionist. It has an excellent view on this side with Metro movements, illuminated Delhi in the backdrop.A nice sumptuous buffet dinner was the main attraction. I was taken around by very experienced restaurant staffs who guided me on selection of food items.I was facilitated while using business centre with computer and a color printer.","May 13, 2015"
"With the moving of my office I was in need of a new hotel. Thankfully this Crown was the perfect choice. Location, service and price, all was good. My only, limited complaints, I consider myself fairly smart, but the light switches got the best of me. One time they turned on the lights, next time, the same one turned off the TV (not quite that bad, but it seemed that way). I felt pretty stupid having to ask someone to come shut my lights off! Also, I could not figure out how to sign up for internet for 7 days. Instead I had to sign up each day. Now I'm told you do a 7 day package, but I missed it. And though I in no way distrust the housekeeping staff, I think it would be in everyone's best interest if the door is propped open, or at least partially, while the room is being cleaned. Just better for the employee and the guests. Lastly, I hate that when I remove my room key from the slot near the door that the electricity at the desk goes off. I leave a laptop plugged in, pull the card as I walk out the door, come back to a dead laptop.That being said, again, really like this place. Will definitely stay here on my next trip. And a special hats off to some staff who went above and beyond making me feel welcomed: Sunil in the restaurant, Devander at the front desk, Rohit in housekeeping and finally, Manju in the spa - what a great massage!!! Kudos to all!!!","May 11, 2015"
"I went to Noida on a business trip and my company booked me on Crown Plaza. The hotel doesn't look good from the outside and the surrounding area is also not good. But the room is very good!

I tried the pool but it is closed for renovations, unfortunately.","May 7, 2015"
"Amazing service and excellent team. We had 35 rooms with varied guests from traditional city Bikaner to most modern Guangzhou city China and from one to all, every single person was complimenting us for excellent arrangements and we accepted them on your behalf. Cost and price stands nowhere in front of in-valuable service provided by your reservation team (Himanshu Trivedi, Shailender,Manoj and F&B Manager,Valets/Bellboys and all).  I will email all the screenshots of sms & messages from our various guests, received on my mobile.  This service quality was inmatchable. Kudos!!!

"The hotel room was really modern and spacious and the restaurant had friendly helpful staff and a good selection of food but we were really really disappointed that there was not pool. All the hotel advertising state there is Pool ( including the hotel website- the in room compendium the in room TV advertising and even in the lifts all say pool ) I queried at the front desk to the age of the hotel as I thought it must be new but was told it was 4 years old. The pool is under construction -and it is an ugly sight when looking from your room window especially when we could see the pool at the Holiday Inn next door.We chose this hotel booked through our travel tour company( they thought it had a pool ) for the fact it had a pool.When we travelled it was 38 degrees so of course a pool would have been great.The hotel is along way from the city too and there is not much around ie no local shops although there is metro station close by but due to the temperature outside we chose not to use this.We were 4 adults travelling two ladies and our adult children who are a couple. I feel this hotel would be more suited as a business hotel.Wifi , breakfast and dinner were included in our room rate the meals especially welcome due to the fact there were no local restaurants nearby. I tried to send a review on the hotel website but it kept telling me my details were incorrect ??","May 4, 2015"
"The hotel is very nice with one of the good Spas in the city. I liked the room, which is much spacious in comparison to the other hotels in the city. Hotel is not so far from the city centre as well as from Noida corporate hub. Good location to the business travelers in Noida and city center.If you are there for tourism also, would recommend to stay in this hotel as it is located very close to Akshardham temple and some other major tourist attractions too. Even if you are going to Tajmahal in Agra, this could be a great location to stay in Delhi as this is very well connected to Taj Express Way also. Rooms are much spacious then other adjacent hotel located at the same place and service is also great. Hotel staff is also very courteous, friendly and always willing to help.A special mention of Mr. Himanshu Trivedi (Manager Reservations) for making the whole process right from booking till check-out effortless.

"When I checked into the hotel, the staff were really nice and gave me an upgrade based on my Gold Ambassador status. When we couldn't connect to the wifi with our iPhones, they sent a tech guy to help sort the problem out. I'm not sure if the wifi is generally free, but it is free for IHG club members, so that was nice. Breakfast was great and again, the staff were really nice. The gym was pretty good too.

As we were on a tour we don't know about its position or transport nearby - we were picked up and dropped off at the hotel. The view from the rooms was a little disappointing but while inside everything was first class. We had breakfast and dinner there at the excellent buffet and we also used the spa for a facial and body massage and this was wonderful.,"April 2, 2015"

Our first two nights in India were spent here. What a delight. The staff could not do enough and with so little effort. Our room was fabulous. Our bed was made for dreams and the bathroom was superb. The Restaurant offered high quality Indian Cuisinne and we enjoyed every meal. I could not fault this hotel. It's location is a bit odd. Why out in the dirt and Industrial zone? Is this area planned to be upmarket in the future? The view was a Freeway and dirt all around as if building sites were in the making.,"March 24, 2015"
"If you have to be in Noida or around Central Delhi, this is a good choice. But what puts one off immediately is the smell from the filthy 'nallah' & sewage plant right across the road. And if you happen to be put into one of the rooms towards the front of the hotel, don't bother opening the curtains during the stay.The rooms at the hotel are very nice - spacious & comfortable, with ample space to keep your stuff, a comfortable & separate sitting & working space & a big bathroom. The only problem I had with the room was the lighting - while mood lighting is lovely, it is impossible to do your make up or read etc. Key places didn't have lights - above a mirror, work table etc. An example of 'good to look at' but totally impractical interior design.Overall service was good but the hotel can certainly improve the breakfast spread. I also felt that prices for services in the spa or the salon were unnecessarily expensive & should certainly be reviewed.","March 24, 2015"
"There is s distinctly unpleasant smell on arrival at the hotel, but it is thankfully not apparent once inside. The rooms are large and modern, beds are divine and pillows left me looking for one to purchase in Australia. The bathroom was outstanding with full bath , separate shower and choice of hand held or raindrop, beautiful! The hotel has won the Times of India award for best mixed origin menu. I totally loved every meal here. Going vegetarian for the duration of our stay was a wise move and food nowhere exceeded the quality of the Crowne Plaza Noida. The breakfast chef cooked the best Masala Dosa I have eaten. The buffet breakfast was marvelous in variety and quality. This hotel left me wanting for nothing, excellent service and luxurious surrounds. Close to the railway means that the out of town location is no impediment. I want to go back.","March 24, 2015"

They are all very very good, make you feel welcome, very professional. Special mention to Sanjay in the restaurant, very pleasant young man helped me with the food choices, and to Manender (on the front door and very smart looking man) who helped when my driver arrived late, he even phoned them for me.

The rooms are clean and looks good. There is a swimming pool in the third floor, but it is being renovated now. Except metro connectivity, you have to rely on the hotel for all your travel needs. There is a strong stench of bad smell, when you come out of the hotel, as the hotel located quiet near to the open drainage.

"If this hotel is not an embarrassment to the IHG Group, then it should be. For potential visitors: if you enjoy the smell of raw sewage (on a good day 'treated sewage' - when the wind is favourable) then this is the place for you. The entire hotel stinks (and this is not a metaphorical description, although it works just as well). The whole place stinks; from the entrance, through to the reception area, to the exclusive outside deck for smokers (replete with rat traps and a bewildering array of pigeon droppings) through to every floor. The 'management' - and the term is deliberately placed within inverted commas - does its best to mask the attendant smells with a cornucopia of equally disgusting synthetic scents, but the smell is as pervasive as the cloying, sycophantic subservience of the staff whose training must have been initiated by someone with an unhealthy reverence for the British colonialists. On the positive side: the rooms are ok, and the food at the ONE restaurant is reasonably good. They make a decent attempt at passing off yesterday's unwanted food at the next 'buffet', and the local, freshly prepared cuisine, is very good. There you go, a positive comment.That's about as good as it gets. It's taken them 7 months to rebuild (sorry, 'renovate'), the pool area - for heaven's sake, a single builder with a trowel and a bucket could have done the same in 4 months - and there are still (February 2015) no signs that it will be completed - it remains a construction site (albeit marginally more aesthetically pleasing than the hotel's environs).Bad hotels often have a 'good location' to temper the awfulness of the property. This hotel is in the middle of nowhere; 50 yards from a fetid river; 75 yards from a sewage treatment plant, and 30 yards (if you get the wrong room) from a railway line.How people can rate this establishment as 'excellent' or even 'good' is utterly beyond me. Oh yes, it's dirt cheap. 'Dirt' being an operative (and appropriate) word.And there is one consolation: it's not as bad as the Holiday Inn next door. That has to be something to be proud of.","February 23, 2015"
"I guess the title of my review sums up my stay. To be fair, the rooms are really nice but it all stops there. I was upgraded to a room that had a view of the sewage treatment plant. The smell is awful and the surrounding of the hotel, including the walk to the nearby metro station, can be intimidating. I booked a taxi through the hotel for day trip and was overcharged by the taxi driver. Overcharged is actually an understatement.. I was charged nearly 80 kms extra than what I had done. I complained to the hotel but they put up their hands and all they had to say was that the taxi company was private and does not belong to the hotel I think that the hotel has a responsibility towards its guests and should stop using the local taxi stand and instead provide the number for a Meru taxi or a radio taxi. If this could happen to me as a person of Indian origin who has lived in New Delhi, I cannot even imagine how foreigners get charged without even realizing that they have been scammed. Would I say there again? probably not...","February 22, 2015"
"Stayed in four hotels in my recent travels around india and I must say I'm not sure what this hotel is trying to be.It's planted in a not very pleasant spot in Delhi, the room and general hotel finishes are poor quality with poor finishing and the bar had a very limited selection including imported low cost beers but not low cost to buy.The food quality was also below what we expected and become accustomed to in similar ranked hotels in India.We therfore booked out earlier than anticipated and went elsewhere.","February 19, 2015"
"I stayed b/w Jan.28-31, 3 nights. During my staying, I enjoyed party at the restaurant. The menu was including Sushi, very delicious. Location is so nice, very cross to the Indian museum and Victoria Memorial and another sightseeing spots and good restaurants. Around the hotel, you can find out the noisy and dirty market, but you feel comfortable to stay in the hotel. Very quiet. Just 45 minutes from International airport by taxi, just 700 Rs．","February 18, 2015"
"I am currently in reaidence for 4 weeks on business & cant wait to vacate this place. The good points are a very comfy bed, food is good, service pleasant......the bad points are: there is no pool so false advertising!!! Its in the middle of nowhere & miles from anywhere, & finally & most importantly there is an open sewage works at the back & a very polluted river at the front, the smell at certain times of day pervade the outside & inside of the hotel & into the one & only restaurant, it makes one gag tremendously & stays inside the mouth & nostrils for ages!!!!! Most unhealthy. Why oh Why have Crowne Plaza with their millions not dredged or cleaned this place up! I understand this hotel is only 4 years old so shame on the builders for putting it here in the first place. I so wish I was in the Suryaa ...","February 14, 2015"
"Due to my work,I am always on wheels/air and travelling across Europe & Asia and as a first preference I always opt for IHG group hotels (Crowne Plaza,HI etc.) and the reason behind it gets very clear when you stay in there.This time I opted for Crowne Plaza during my trip to India & I found a great hospitality at front desk,well maintained fitness club along with Sauna/Steam bath,healthy & delicious breakfast,very much spacious rooms,good comfort and a personal care just like in a Family,I have been staying in lot of IHG properties in Europe and believe me this is one of best property in terms of standard,comfort,price & hospitality.Room Service is very quick & availability of front desk is amazing.I must say Well done IHG & all my thanks to Mr Sunny Chadha (Director,Sales) who gave me all the comfort and suggested me to try this property,I have been already staying now here since last 2 weeks & my stay is now extended for next 8 weeks :) so excited about it as I feel comfort in here.","January 23, 2015"
Stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip. Good location for work in Noida. Staff is great. Rooms were in great shape. Breakfast buffet was pretty good. Wifi could have been stronger in the room. Would stay here again,"January 23, 2015"
"I have reviewed nearly 60 hotels on Tripadvisor and I believe that this hotel is most difficult to rate. When I checked out, my rating of the hotel was definitely 'Five stars', however, I cannot ignore what I found out after I checked out. I stayed at this hotel for four nights in December. Due to the regulation of my company, I booked this hotel through my work's designated travel agency. I had a voucher issued by the travel agency with a confirmation details.When I checked in after a long flight on December 17th, I was told by the front desk that my reservation had been cancelled by my travel agency and thus I had no room. I presented my voucher and told the gentleman that I would like to follow the instruction described on the voucher (i.e. to call correct to the agency's office in Singapore). However, the hotel personal was reluctant to do so. Instead they offered a 'special rate' to secure four nights of the room which was about 30% higher than I had originally paid to the travel agent. As I had no choice under the circumstances. I accepted the offer and was checked in the room, which was well equipped. The hotel people all looked professional and at this point, I believed that the confusion was due to my travel agency. Therefore, I thanked to the manager at the front desk for them to handle the problem professionally. At the same time, I mad several international calls to my travel agency in Japan to resolve the issues.The four nights' stay was excellent, and when I checked out, I once again thanked them for their help. The gentleman who checked me out requested me to fill out the 'feedback' form specifying his name (as he was one of the people who helped me on Day one) which I did with pleasure. At the same time, I asked the front desk about a card (with a message from manager saying 'Apologize for the inconvenience' and a plate of fruits delivered to the room the night before (while I was out) The people at the front desk were not sure what it was. As I did not want to miss the flight, I had to leave without finding it out.A few days later, I found out through my travel agency as well as IHS representative in Tokyo that the reservation was intact when I checked in (with sufficient evidence), and thus it was simply the mistake of the hotel. They also said that the hotel was informed of the error on my Day 2 and thus they should have explained it to me. I believe that the card and fruit plate must have had something to do with it. I am not sure that if they did it to sincerely apologize the error or just to 'conceal' the error. In any cases, they should have explained to me what was really going on.I can still say that the stay was pleasant and the most staff members were of high professional standard, yet I am hesitant to recommend this hotel to the readers until the management full explain what actually went on rather than simply leaving a fruit plate in my room without explanation.","January 17, 2015"
Travelled in July 2014 on a business Trip. We stayed there for 5 days.The Front office people are very efficient and helped us check in within 10 minutes of our arrival. Since we had already opted for a non smoking room we got the same and were in our rooms in the next 5 minutes.The rooms are very big with beautiful Metro View.The Breakfast was complimentary and pretty much all the variety were available.Room Service was also very quick and they operate 24/7.Overall a great 4 Star Stay,"January 6, 2015"
"Recently during my visit to Delhi- I stayed at Crown Plaza- Mayur Vihar (Delhi). This is not the best hotel when comes to infrastruccture and stay in comfort ( not at par with Crown Plaza brand). In terms of services, I woudl rate it a average. There are a few branded hotels nearby in Noida if you are looking at a good value for money.","January 2, 2015"
"Well first and foremost, I have stayed in this hotel more than a dozen times so this review will be one of the most helpful to you.The Property is amazing and it is a sheer pleasure staying here, the staff is very helpful and treat you with utmost respect. The rooms are big with luxurious. Although food is on the expensive side but considering this to a 5star property it is manageable.My sincere request to anyone who drinks, there is a liquor mall just behind the hotel so bring in the liquor and order food in your room it will be an amazing experience.If you are looking for decent place and have come for a business/leisure travel then this is a place to be, you might also get lucky and catch a few celebrities in the hotel during your stay.Cheers.","December 26, 2014"
The hotel is just new. The prices with around 7500 are quite good. Rooms are typical and restaurants too. Breakfast is very nice with very variaty. The gym is fine. Employees very friendly. For me a good alternative for greater Noida.,"December 22, 2014"
"I spent 3 days for some business visits in Noida and the huge, soft bed is amazing. I slept wonderful at the spacious room. The hotel employees are very friendly and willing to help with anything. The breakfast was good, but I missed some sandwich filling. The menu card content was fine, I really like the classical burger they served as well as the minestrone soup. All the transfers I had were hotel arranged transfers. This service can be a little bit improved. As an example I was waiting for the cab while the chauffeur was waiting for me while nobody was contacting me. The fixed line internet at the room is good for e.g. Skype (~6Mb UL/DL). Wifi is pretty much the same but you have to pay for both services unfortunately.Overall I enjoyed my visit at this hotel.","December 19, 2014"
"I stayed there 2 nights and had a really comfortable stay! The bed is huge and amazingly soft, the room very spacious and the buffet breakfast delicious. The pool was closed but they provided me a cab to another pool in another hotel nearby. The concierge was very helpful and all staff courteous. Definitely a place to stay!","December 11, 2014"
"I recently visited Infinity restaurant, Hotel Crowne Plaza for a buffet lunch affair. Must say that it offered a warm hospitality, impeccable service and care for the guests need. Service staff was very courteous, helpful and always responsive for your searching looks of any assistance. One extremely good thing about Infinity is its open spaces, and a naturally lit ambiance. Ample sunlight glows up the space, enhancing the mood and the decor alike. Winter sun makes it all the more cozy and comfortable.And the most important, the food is top class. Assortment of soups, starters, main course, beverages, fruits and desserts makes it a wholesomely appetizing affair. Live kitchen, dishing out the pastas and hot bread, adds to the food sparkle. You crave for more and more! True satisfaction to your senses and soul! One must visit, if you truly wish to relish a delectable buffet meal amid really peaceful settings.Anil Bisht","December 3, 2014"
"One of the best in it's category we experienced thus far in India. Great room, awesome bathroom... Very comfortable and large bed... And excellent breakfast buffet. It's location is not ideal and bar is a bit sad ... But as getting around is in any case difficult this hotel is definitely a good choice as a base to discover Delhi ","December 3, 2014"
"We stayed 3 nights at this wonderful hotel. The rooms were just great, the food was better than we expected, the staff was friendly and attentiv. All except the waiters in the restaurant. They were friendly all right, but completely unorganised, forgetting things all the time, pouring red wine when we ordered white, forgetting coffe, etc. etc. That is why this establishment gets one point off.","November 18, 2014"
Good hotel with all the amenities ...stayed I the 14th Floor. Good location... very good for business traveller having work in Noida. Breakfast is very good but the service is a little disoriented.

I stayed here for 1 night .we were in group so had booked 3 rooms.Its typical Crown plaza hotel but i felt that lots have to be done in front office.we checked in around 7 pm but our surprise no one was present at front office .one attended from concierge tried to check us in leaving guest to move luggage around .The rooms are pretty big and adequate for 3 persons.The breakfast offered is plenty with lots of variety .Another think that perhaps front office failed to update my stay for points in rewards club.i guess there is something missing in front office,"November 10, 2014"

The staff were very friendly and helpful, especially when we arrived after 15 hours of travelling. The buffet breakfast was great, plenty of choice with an excellent omelette chef!

This hotel was such a pleasure to stay in. I have never slept on such a good mattress ever!! Would have liked to extend my stay indefinitely. The rooms are beautiful and very clean and the meals were very enjoyable as well. The only drawback was no Wifi. There is Wifi but you have to pay for it and it is for an hour only. There is wifi in the lobby but again only for an hour. Other than this everything else was fine.,"September 2, 2014"

"Location of the hotel is great. 10 mins drive to Noida, 15 mins to South Delhi via DND and 20 mins to Connaught Place by the Metro. Rooms are spacious, staff courteous. They have a well quipped gym, a nice pool with steam and sauna in change rooms. Breakfast buffet spread is decent but nothing stands out - most hotels in India have a far better breakfast spread and their peers abroad. Here I felt disappointed. They don't have any specialty restaurant either. Other than food, a very good business hotel.","June 25, 2014"
"I stayed at Crowne Plaza Mayur Vihar for one night with my family during a recent visit to India. We had four rooms as there were 10 of us. I see some reviews stating that the location is in the middle of nowhere; however, I was visiting family in Mayur Vihar so this was perfect for me.The hotel reception is very well designed and the rooms are also spacious. My niece and nephew's had a wonderful time at the open pool on the 3rd floor. The staff at this hotel is excellent. Shailendra, Nitin and Girraj really helped us and made our stay wonderful. The breakfast buffet at Infinity was very good. All in all a very good hotel!","June 17, 2014"

"This is a review only of the spa.Went for a 3 hour package and it was the best I have ever experienced! I fell asleep and my skin was glowing! It included body exfoliation, hot stone massage and an aromatherapy facial.Spa staff were excellent. Products used were very good.The steam room is good. Only drawback is that you have to walk across the floor to reach your spa room. The spa room is big and beautiful with a spacious bathroom. For some reason the sink did not stock any soap. I should have asked. Anyway, I used the showergel which smelt very nice.Very safe to keep your belongings in the cupboard. The ambience of the room and the spa reception is very welcoming, warm and beautiful.","April 28, 2014"

"I had a meeting with FTO, so I chose to stay in this hotel as its close to Noida...I got a great price-thanks to Siddartha Yadav..now talking about the hotel, it took some time to get my room, as I wanted pool view room and lower floor and yes after 20 minutes they (check in staff and lad named Devendra) made it possible. Room view was stunning. Waiting was worth. Room was quite spacious. Rooms amenities were perfect. Duvet was up to the mark and cozy bed was quite comfortable. I ordered Veg Penne Pasta with chocolate brownie in room and it was served hot and it tasted amazing. Dinner was little disappointing though. I think if Chef could work lil bit for taste buds of guests, it can make a remarkable effect. After being disappointed by curries, chef made nice chicken pizza, which definitely pleased us at the end. Morning breakfast was good. I will not rate it as very good as still it could not impress my taste buds. Sambhar was quite thick, poha was bland, so was Sabzi...Poori was very oily too..All I could enjoy was fresh fruits, mysore pakodas with chutney and muffins with nice cappuccino....Pool was clean and we enjoyed swimming thoroughly..Check out was lil slow due to some discrepancy with the best price I was offered, but at the end it went okay...Overall, it is great property to stay in. I enjoyed my stay..Will definitely stay again for next coming meetings...its good option for family too as location is good....Thanks to Siddhartha and Devendra...","April 13, 2014"

I stayed here for 3 nights.There was a great Indian buffet and restaurant's food was delisious but you don't have lot of option for Breakfast. The staff are very friendly. My room was clean and tidy and well serviced with turn down service every evening but wifi did't work in our room.hotel's location is far from city center but metro was very close and you can rent a car with driver to take you anywhere and wait for you to take you back with reasonable price.Reception clean and the staff are very efficient and answer questions with clarity,"March 29, 2014"
This was my first visit to New Delhi - and India in fact. I wanted to be reasonably close to the main centre of New Delhi for meetings so I chose the Crowne Plaza.Overall I found this hotel to be great. The staff were very helpful and arranged transport for me to get into town and back plus to other calls. The big benefit was the pick up at the airport - especially late in the evening.The food in Infinity was of good quality. The room was very pleasantly arranged and well kept.One small niggle - Perhaps the hotel could update their contact details and provide a working email address - very useful when trying to confirm dates etc. The current email address on their website does not work.Good job !,"March 29, 2014"
"I stayed here for a few days. My package included dinner, breakfast and unlimited wifi. There was a great Indian buffet some nights. Breakfast is also fine with good coffee. The staff are very friendly. My room has fine and well cleaned. Loved the fresh flowers, but I tend to prefer my towels to be towels - not swans! (Am I a kill-joy?!). My only issue is that I would have loved to swim in the pool, but noticed that many pigeons like to bath there too!","March 28, 2014"
I'll make this one short..I loved it......the only thing bad I could say about this 1 is that I had work mostly in Central and South Delhi and from this hotel it took quite a while getting there....This property is a marked improvement from my previous 2 stays at Holiday inn and Fraser Suites (both situated in Mayur Vihar)..The rooms were beautiful....neat and clean and spacious with all amenities..The breakfast was yummy....and the staff courteous..Would definitely return next time if I have work in the area..,"March 12, 2014"
"Location of the hotel is near the tube about a five minute walk, or grab a TukTuk for about 60 rupees. Go for the high rooms at the back of the hotel overlooking the Metro line, they have the best views. Room clean and tidy and well serviced with turn down service every evening.Shame about the wifi only being free for 30 minutes and available only in the lobby, I would expect a Crowne Plaza of this quality to offer it free. The one in Cochin gives no free time.Breakfast is a good choice and the wait is short, hot food cooked to order by the chefs and they do an excellent job.Reception clean and the staff are very efficient and answer questions with clarity.Excellent sauna and steam plus the gym which was empty when i was there. I did not have any treatments due to lack of time.I stayed here for two nights","March 3, 2014"

"The hotel installation was good, bud I think the front desk staff need be training again. When I reached the hotel, first, they give me a occupied unclean room, that is easy to solve but I didn't get any apologize. In the second day, when I back from outside, my key is not working for the elevator, after change the card, I found can't unlock my room door, because they put wrong data into the system and show me should check out when I will stay for 3 night more. When I check out, I found that my car arranged day before are in wrong time, they put into the system my flight time and arrange the car for same time, when day before they told me sure be leave the hotel two hours before. I can say, everyday have a surprise waiting me, this is not the level for a Crowne Plaza Hotel that I feel, at least in Latin America, I feel better and have very good experience before.","February 14, 2014"
"Happened to stay at this property during my recent trip to NCR. Interiors are tastefully done and the rooms are spacious and big and comfortable . Overall it gets my thumbs up, however was disappointed at the morning breakfast buffet and dinner the previous night .The layout was not comfortable and there is a lot of back and forth to fill your plate . Also want not satisfied by the spread also . It was quite limiting considering the quality of the hotel and the price one pays for the stay .","February 12, 2014"

Also very kind and helpful people at the reception.Going to the gate of india is not too far either and if you want to have a splendid time, go for a drink to the Taj.","January 27, 2014"

Attitude makes all the difference. Customer Service is an excellent example. We wanted to travel in Delhi for 8 hours by car and the way in which Rajiv from Customer Service Desk organised for us is worth praising. Rooms are big enough to move around with the bags. Bathroom has all the amenities that you are looking for. But I wish there was a curtain between Bathroom clear glass and bedroom. (May be we are bit conservative).Food was excellent and hot breakfast that was provided to be good for any appetite.Beds and pillows were of excellent quality,"January 19, 2014"
"This Hotel is situated next door to the Double Tree Hilton, rather a long way out by car from airport and from central New Delhi. Very isolated and right next to highways and train tracks, no shops or resturants within walking distance. There are far more better options in New Delhi, I tried this hotel once but won't return again. Not one particular problem, it's the overall package of location, travel distances and perculiar lengthy check out procedure, large credit card payment on check in and confused staff.( and unheated outdoor pool overlooking highways)I also had a rather poor experience of service during my stay in that each time I ordered a car and driver, they were always late arriving at hotel, so rather ruined my schedule of meetings in New Delhi a few times. Though I'm sure that was just bad luck.The executive lounge concept in this hotel is very confused, uniquely it's set within the normal hotel bar, and the staff don't really know one day to the next what the executive lounge service is compared to normal bar, so don't expect too much here ! Very below the standard of normal Asian hotel arrangements. If all other hotels are full, and you have one night in this hotel, it's satisfactory - but not for a few days visiting this great city.","November 26, 2013"
Stayed at the hotel for 2 nights.. Nice hotel with efficient staff.. The in room dining could do better with better range given that there isn't any restaurant within walking distance... Their checkout process was a tad bit slow even though they had the billing information on file and had given 10 minutes heads up...,"November 21, 2013"
It is great experience to be in HILTON group and enjoyed life with my family and very good hot food made our experience more good. The staff was very cooperative and SPA and pool really re-juvenile you for good work.,"November 7, 2013"
"This is a very professional hotel, primarily suited for business travelers. We were a family of 4 and got checked in a very descent size room, king size bed, sofa, bathtub and rain shower and also with a distant view of the Akshayadham temple. Breakfast spread was ok, not great, especially since we just checked out of ITC Mughal at Agra, which definitely was of a much higher order than this hotel. This is a kind of hotel which you will have nothing to complaint about and yet nothing to be delighted about as well. Staff was extremely helpful. The front desk arranged us a cab for local sight seeing, the breakfast counter lady gave tips about shopping and bargaining at nearby Atta market. The stench from the nearby open drain was horrible. Thankfully it never entered the hotel and bothered us only when we went out. Since we were there during Diwali, wish they could have arranged something special for the guests on that day. Being too American does nor work out in an Indian context, so this hotel needs to improvise rather than import the impersonal style of a Hilton in US.","November 6, 2013"
"1st time in Delhi- good staff, nice restaurant and rooms, and quite good value for the rooms. Would definitely recommend for anyone staying in Delhi for business or leisure. Didn't get a chance to try the pool or spa facilities but these looked excellent.","November 5, 2013"
"Hotel is about a 30 minute ride to Delhi, is isolated and encassed behind a wall. We did not receive an upgrade nor was the executive lounge open. Breakfast and internet access were good. Staff were helpful. This hotel is not situated for the tourist. After December 2013 it will no longer be a Hilton.","November 1, 2013"
"Really nice place. The rooms were great and the staff were great as well. Reception team was very cordial. Loved the setting of the room. Room was as clean as a whistle including the bathroom. breakfast options were great. Being a bacon lover, was happy they had that on offer. French toast for breakfast was just awesome.
